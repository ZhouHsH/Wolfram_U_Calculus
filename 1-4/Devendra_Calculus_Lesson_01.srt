00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone, and welcome to Introduction to Calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好，欢迎与Wolfram U一起学习微积分入门。

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Devendra Kapadia, and I work here at Wolfram Research
我叫Devendra Kapadia，我在Wolfram Research工作

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
as a kernel developer for calculus functions. But I also enjoy teaching mathematics,
作为微积分功能的内核开发人员。但我也喜欢教数学

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and it’s a great pleasure to have this opportunity to talk about calculus with you.
很高兴有机会与您讨论微积分。

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now today is the first lesson, so I thought we would spend some time talking about what is calculus
今天是第一课，所以我想我们会花一些时间来讨论什么是微积分

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and trying to understand what this beautiful subject is all about. I’ll begin by defining calculus,
并试图了解这个美丽的主题到底是什么。我将从定义微积分开始，

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and then we’ll talk a little bit about the main problems of calculus, some history,
然后我们将讨论微积分的主要问题，一些历史，

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and then I’ll tell you why you might want to study the course, and what the course is all about.
然后我会告诉你为什么要学习本课程，以及本课程的全部内容。

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let’s begin by answering the question what is calculus?
让我们首先回答以下问题：什么是微积分？

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, very simply, calculus is the science of change. Now, change is all around us.
好吧，很简单，微积分是研究变化的科学。现在，变化无处不在。

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
For instance, the second hand on this clock changes its position every second, but you could have
例如，该时钟的秒针每秒都在更改其位置，但是您可以看到自然界中存在着

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
more complicated motion. For example, the planets in the solar system change their position
更复杂的运动。例如，太阳系中的行星在绕着太阳旋转的每个时刻

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
at every instant as they revolve around the sun. Now in the first case,
都在改变它的位置。现在在第一种情况下

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
for the motion of the second hand around a clock, you could use simple arithmetic algebra
对于秒针围绕时钟的运动，您可以使用简单的算术代数来分析问题，

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to analyze a problem, but in more difficult cases like the solar system motion,
但是在更困难的情况下，例如研究太阳系运动，

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
you would need better tools to analyze the motion, and one such tool is calculus.
您将需要更好的工具来分析运动，而这样的工具之一就是微积分。

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Calculus is an essential tool for deeply understanding change in a mathematical way, and hence,
微积分是一种以数学方式深刻理解变化的重要工具，因此，

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
it is a tool of choice for many scientific problems. The next question is
它是许多科学问题的首选工具。接下来我将阐述，

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
what are the main problems that drove the development of calculus?
导致微积分发展的主要问题是什么？

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, the four main problems of calculus are first, the problem of finding the tangent line
微积分的四个主要问题如下：首先是寻找曲线上某一点处的切线的问题。

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to a curve at a point. Now if the curve is sufficiently simple like a circle,
现在，如果曲线足够简单，如圆形，

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you can of course draw the tangent line to the curve at that point, but in more complicated cases,
您当然可以在该点绘制曲线的切线，但是在更复杂的情况下，

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
you would need something like calculus to solve the problem.
您将需要微积分来解决问题。

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Number two is the problem of finding the area under a curve.
第二个问题是找到曲线下的面积。

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now once again, if, let’s say, you have a circle, then finding the area is not very difficult.
现在再说一次，如果您有一个圆圈，那么求出该面积并不是很困难。

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But for more complicated curves, you would need better tools. Now from the point of view
但是对于更复杂的曲线，您将需要更好的工具。现在来考虑物理问题

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
of physics, you might sometimes need to find, let’s say, the velocity the a particle
您有时可能需要找到一个给定位置和加速度的粒子的速度

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
given either its position or acceleration, and once again,
同样地，

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you can use calculus to solve this problem.
您可以使用微积分解决此问题。

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And finally, from time to time, you are going to want to either maximize or minimize some quantity,
最后，又是如果您想要最大化或最小化某些量，

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and the common word for that is optimizing. For example, a businessman might want
（最常用的词就是优化）。例如，一个商人可能想要

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,000
to maximize his profits or minimize his loss, and once again, calculus is the tool
最大化他的利润或最小化他的损失，同样地，

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
which helps us to study the process of optimization.
微积分是我们研究优化过程的重要工具。

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay. Let’s look at each of these in a bit more detail. Let’s start with tangent to a curve.
好了。我们现在来看一些更细节的东西。让我们从曲线的切线开始。

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let’s begin with the tangent to a curve. Now to find a tangent line at a point, what we do is
我们从曲线的切线开始。现在要找到一点的切线，我们要做的是

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
we draw the secant lines from nearby points. Let’s say we want to find a tangent at this point over here.
我们从附近的点画出割线。假设我们要在此处找到切线。

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We start with a point, in this case far away, and let the secant line change
我们从一个点开始，在这种情况下，它很远，然后让割线改变

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
by moving the point along the curve. Let’s run this animation over here.
通过沿曲线移动点。让我们在这里运行该动画。

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What you’ll see is that as the point moves to the required point,
您会看到，随着点移动到所需点，

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the secant becomes closer and closer to the tangent. Okay. To summarize,
割线越来越接近切线。好的。总而言之，

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
as a secant gets closer to the desired point, you’re going to get the tangent line.
当割线接近所需的点时，您将得到切线。

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now onto the second problem for calculus, and that’s the problem of finding the area
现在到微积分的第二个问题，那就是求出区域面积

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
or length of a curve. Here is an animation in which we can talk about the area
或曲线的长度的问题。这是一个动画，我们可以在其中探究这个区域

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
of a regular polygon when the number of sides goes from 3 to 50. Let’s begin with the case of <i>n</i> = 3,
当边数从3变到50时，它变为正多边形。让我们从<i>n</i> = 3 的情况开始，

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
where you have a triangle, and then as you increase the number of sides, you see what happens
那里有一个三角形，然后随着边数的增加，您会看到发生了什么

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
the perimeter and the area. Let’s run animation. You see that as the number of sides increases,
周边和区域。让我们运行动画。您会看到随着边数的增加，

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
the polygon approaches the circumscribed circle. Of course in this case, you know that when you have
多边形接近外接圆。当然，在这种情况下，您知道

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
an infinite number of sides, then you get the area of the full circle, which is just π if the radius is 1.
如果你有无限多个边，则可以得到整个圆的面积，如果半径为1，那么面积就是π。

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay. On to the third problem for calculus, and that is what is called the velocity problem.
好的。关于微积分的第三个问题，那就是速度问题。

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Here we have a particle that is moving along around a knotted curve. At each stage, you have the velocity
在这里，我们有一个沿着打结曲线移动的粒子。在每个阶段，您都知道粒子
的速度

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and the acceleration, so you have the tangent and the normal, as we call it,
和加速度，所以我们有切线和法线，如我们所说，

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and the problem might be to compute the velocity and acceleration at any time in a very accurate way.
问题是如何精确计算任意时刻粒子的速度和加速度
53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Once again, you can use calculus for this.
再一次地，您可以为此使用微积分。

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Finally, on to the problem of optimization. Let’s say a farmer has 500 feet of fencing available,
最后，讨论优化问题。假设一个农夫有500英尺的栅栏，

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and the farmer wants to fence off a rectangle with the maximum area. The question is
农民想用最大面积的矩形围起来。问题是

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
what should the dimensions of the rectangle be? Let’s look at this interactive model over here.
矩形的尺寸应该是多少？让我们在这里看看这个交互式模型。

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You see that as you change the dimensions, you get more and more area. It increases up to certain point,
您会看到，随着更改尺寸，您将获得越来越大的面积。它增加到一定程度，

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and then it starts to shrink again. It would look like the best way to optimize over here would be
然后又开始收缩。看起来在这里进行优化的最佳方法是

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
to choose a rectangle which is, in fact, a square of 125 feet by 125 feet, but the question is
选择一个实际上是125英尺乘125英尺的正方形的矩形，但是问题是

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
how would you have arrived at the solution without trial and error?
您将如何在没有反复试验的情况下得出解决方案？

61
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Calculus gives you a systematic way of solving such problems.
微积分为您提供了解决此类问题的系统方法。

62
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Now of course the ancient Greeks knew quite a lot about solving such problems,
当然，古希腊人对此类问题已经有很多的认识，

63
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
but it was only in the 17th century that mathematicians started to look a little deeper into
但是直到17世纪，数学家才开始更深入地研究

64
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
how one could solve each of these four problems. The French lawyer and mathematician Pierre de Fermat
如何解决这四个问题。法国律师兼数学家Pierre de Fermat

65
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
developed a method for drawing tangents and finding maxima and minima.
发明了一种绘制切线并找到最大值和最小值的方法。

66
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The clergymen John Wallis found ways, for example, to find the value of π/2 and do it quite accurately.
神职人员约翰·沃利斯（John Wallis）找到了一些方法来求出π/ 2的值并相当准确地做到这一点。

67
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Johannes Kepler, the great astronomer, used the method of the Greeks to find
伟大的天文学家约翰尼斯·开普勒（Johannes Kepler）用希腊人的方法求出了

68
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to find the volume of wine barrels, and in fact in doing so, he touched upon the questions of
酒桶的体积，实际上，他谈到了以下问题：

69
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
finding volumes and finding maxima and minima, so he really is one of the pioneers of calculus.
求出体积并找到其最大值和最小值，所以他确实是微积分的先驱之一。

70
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Of course at that point, geometry was still the method of choice for many problems,
当然，在那时，几何仍然是许多问题的选择方法，

71
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
so Isaac Barrow in England showed how to calculate the tangent to a curve
所以英国的Isaac Barrow展示了如何使用纯粹的几何方法

72
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
using purely geometrical means. So Fermat, Wallis, Kepler and Barrow were the early pioneers
来计算曲线的切线。因此，费马，沃利斯，开普勒和巴罗是微积分以及许多其他方法的先驱。

73
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
of calculus, along with many others. Now you might read in books or elsewhere that
现在您可能会在书本或其他地方阅读到，

74
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Newton and Leibniz discovered calculus. The question is
牛顿和莱布尼兹发现了微积分。问题是

75
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
in what sense are they regarded as pioneers and discovers of calculus in the true sense?
在什么意义上，他们被视为真正意义上的微积分的先驱和发现？

76
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The point is that although the early mathematicians knew about calculus one way or the other,
关键是，尽管早期的数学家以某种方式发展了微积分，

77
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
it was only Newton and Leibniz who gave general methods for doing calculus.
只有牛顿和莱布尼兹给出了进行微积分的通用方法。

78
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
In fact, they put together all the earlier knowledge and found relations between
实际上，他们将所有前人的知识放在一起，并发明了

79
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
the various concepts of calculus. One question was who discovered calculus first?
微积分的各种概念。一个争论是谁首先发现了微积分？

80
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Was it Newton or Leibniz? Well, Leibniz published his paper first,
是牛顿还是莱布尼兹？莱布尼兹首先发表了他的论文，

81
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:39,000
but then Newton had already shared his ideas on calculus with others. In England people said
但是后来牛顿已经与其他人分享了他关于微积分的想法。在英格兰，人们说

82
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:49,000
oh, Newton discovered calculus, while elsewhere in Europe, the support was all for Leibniz.
哦，牛顿发现了微积分，而在欧洲其他地方，人们都说莱布尼茨是微积分之父。

83
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Well, today it doesn’t matter a lot, and we regard Newton and Leibniz as the joint creators of calculus,
今时今日，这些争论已经无关紧要了，我们认为牛顿和莱布尼兹是微积分的共同创造者，

84
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
for it was they who gave a unified way of looking at concepts in this subject to us,
因为正是他们为我们提供了一种统一的方式来研究这一主题的概念，

85
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and today we talk of the Newton and Leibniz approach to calculus. Now beyond Newton–Leibniz,
今天我们讨论牛顿和莱布尼兹的微积分方法。现在超越牛顿-莱布尼兹，

86
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
people went on making improvements to calculus.
人们继续改进微积分。

87
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The Bernoulli brothers were very active in this area. In fact, Johann Bernoulli wrote the first
伯努利兄弟在这一领域非常活跃。实际上，约翰·伯努利（Johann Bernoulli）写了第一本

88
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
the first differential calculus textbook informally; it was L’Hospital who actually published it.
第一本微积分学非正式的教科书；实际上它是医院出版的。

89
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Maria Agnesi—lady mathematician—she was the eldest of 21 children, and still found time
玛丽亚·阿格尼丝（Maria Agnesi）-一位女数学家-她是21个孩子中的老大，寻找时间

90
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to do calculus and write a book that covered both differential and integral calculus.
研究微积分并写一本涵盖微积分和积分的书。

91
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But the modern foundations of calculus, what made it really nice and precise,
但是是微积分的现代基础使它变得非常精确，

92
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
were given by Cauchy and Weierstrass, and it was they who finally told us
这是柯西和维尔斯特拉斯给出的，是他们最终

93
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
how to approach calculus in a very rigorous and complete manner.
得出了处理微积分的非常严格和完整的方式。

94
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Now although all these pioneers did a lot of work, things did not stop over there.
现在，尽管所有这些先驱者都做了很多工作，但事情并没有就此止步。

95
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Even today, we have calculus being used in many, many areas. For example, quantum mechanics,
直到今天，微积分仍在许多领域中使用。例如量子力学

96
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
which is the study of matter at the atomic level, uses the Schrӧdinger equation,
这是在原子水平上对物质的研究，使用Schrӧdinger方程，

97
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:28,000
which is a product of calculus. If you go to financial markets, then the Black–Scholes equation is used
这是微积分的产物。在金融领域，则会使用Black–Scholes方程

98
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
to find the prices of options. The Black–Scholes equation, in fact, uses what are called
来计算期权的价格。实际上，Black-Scholes方程使用的是所谓的

99
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
partial differential equations. When Albert Einstein wanted to discover the laws of gravitation,
偏微分方程。当爱因斯坦想发现万有引力定律时，

100
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
he had to turn to calculus, something called Ricci calculus, and his friend Marcel Grossmann
他不得不求助于微积分学，即所谓的Ricci微积分学，他的朋友Marcel Grossmann
101
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
taught him the details, but Albert Einstein developed the so-called general theory of relativity
教会了他细节，但爱因斯坦根据微积分发展了

102
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
based on calculus. If you study economics and you want to study markets, you need calculus.
相对论。如果您学习经济学并且想学习市场运转规律，也需要微积分。

103
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If you want to study medicine, you need calculus to figure out dosing strategies.
如果您想学习医学，则需要进行微积分计算剂量策略。

104
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Of course even if you go to NASA, you would find that they use calculus all the time
当然，即使您去NASA，也会发现他们一直在使用微积分

105
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
to figure out how to design and how to propel their rockets. The point is calculus continues to be
去研究如何设计和推进火箭。微积分是许多不同领域的关键工具。

106
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
a key tool in many different areas. But you might ask okay, that’s fine;
但是你可能会问“OK，
107
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
it’s really useful to some people, but why is it useful to me?
它对某些人确实有用，但是为什么对我有用？”

108
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Why should I study calculus? Well, I already gave the first reason. The first reason is that
我为什么要学习微积分？我已经给出了第一个理由。第一个原因是

109
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
it has very broad applications in the real world. The other point is a more practical one—
它在现实世界中具有非常广泛的应用。另一点是更实际的一点-

110
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
that if you are studying any kind of STEM degree in science or technology, then they would ask you
如果您正在攻读任何类型的科学或技术的STEM学位，那么他们会要求您

111
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
to first master calculus before doing anything else. It’s a prerequisite which you must go through
在做其他事情之前先掌握微积分。如果您想成为技术专家，

112
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
if you want to become a technical kind of person. Now on the other hand, you can say that
这是您必须经过的前提条件。另一方面，您可以说

113
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I’m not going to go into any of these STEM fields; I just am going to pursue my own interests.
我将不打算涉及任何这些STEM领域。我只是为了追求自己的利益。

114
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, that’s fine, but for anyone to master calculus represents a major academic milestone
这很好，但是对任何人而言，掌握微积分都是一个学术里程碑。

好的。有关课程本身的一些知识。本课程将有40节课，这是一个40部分的课程，

119
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and roughly speaking, the course is based on the AP Calculus AB in this country, the US.
大致而言，该课程基于美国这个国家的AP Calculus AB。

120
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The AP Calculus course is a pretty challenging high-school level course, and I thought that
AP微积分课程是一门颇具挑战性的高中课程，我

121
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
it would be good to get more people into studying calculus early and preparing themselves
希望有更多的人尽早学习微积分并做好

122
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
for applying it in their own careers. Now we’ll begin with standard topics like functions and limits,
将其应用于自己的职业的准备。现在，我们将从函数和极限之类的标准主题开始，

123
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and having done that, we will move onto differential calculus and finally we will move on to integral calculus.
然后，我们将探讨微分，最后将探讨积分。

但主要的一点是，我们将专注于理解，并且几乎没有

128
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
formal proofs for any theorems, so the advantage of that is that we can focus on visualization,
任何定理的形式证明，所以它的优点是我们可以专注于微积分的可视化，
