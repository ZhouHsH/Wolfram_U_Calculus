Hello everyone, and welcome to Introduction to Calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Devendra Kapadia, and I work here at Wolfram Research

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
as a kernel developer for calculus functions. But I also enjoy teaching mathematics,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and it’s a great pleasure to have this opportunity to talk about calculus with you.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now today is the first lesson, so I thought we would spend some time talking about what is calculus

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and trying to understand what this beautiful subject is all about. I’ll begin by defining calculus,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and then we’ll talk a little bit about the main problems of calculus, some history,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and then I’ll tell you why you might want to study the course, and what the course is all about.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let’s begin by answering the question what is calculus?

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, very simply, calculus is the science of change. Now, change is all around us.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
For instance, the second hand on this clock changes its position every second, but you could have

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
more complicated motion. For example, the planets in the solar system change their position

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
at every instant as they revolve around the sun. Now in the first case,

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
for the motion of the second hand around a clock, you could use simple arithmetic algebra

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to analyze a problem, but in more difficult cases like the solar system motion,

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
you would need better tools to analyze the motion, and one such tool is calculus.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Calculus is an essential tool for deeply understanding change in a mathematical way, and hence,

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
it is a tool of choice for many scientific problems. The next question is

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
what are the main problems that drove the development of calculus?

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, the four main problems of calculus are first, the problem of finding the tangent line

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to a curve at a point. Now if the curve is sufficiently simple like a circle,

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you can of course draw the tangent line to the curve at that point, but in more complicated cases,

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
you would need something like calculus to solve the problem.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Number two is the problem of finding the area under a curve.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now once again, if, let’s say, you have a circle, then finding the area is not very difficult.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But for more complicated curves, you would need better tools. Now from the point of view

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
of physics, you might sometimes need to find, let’s say, the velocity the a particle

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
given either its position or acceleration, and once again,

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you can use calculus to solve this problem.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And finally, from time to time, you are going to want to either maximize or minimize some quantity,

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and the common word for that is optimizing. For example, a businessman might want

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,000
to maximize his profits or minimize his loss, and once again, calculus is the tool

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
which helps us to study the process of optimization.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay. Let’s look at each of these in a bit more detail. Let’s start with tangent to a curve.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let’s begin with the tangent to a curve. Now to find a tangent line at a point, what we do is

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
we draw the secant lines from nearby points. Let’s say we want to find a tangent at this point over here.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We start with a point, in this case far away, and let the secant line change

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
by moving the point along the curve. Let’s run this animation over here.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What you’ll see is that as the point moves to the required point,

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the secant becomes closer and closer to the tangent. Okay. To summarize,

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
as a secant gets closer to the desired point, you’re going to get the tangent line.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now onto the second problem for calculus, and that’s the problem of finding the area

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
or length of a curve. Here is an animation in which we can talk about the area

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
of a regular polygon when the number of sides goes from 3 to 50. Let’s begin with the case of <i>n</i> = 3,

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
where you have a triangle, and then as you increase the number of sides, you see what happens

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
the perimeter and the area. Let’s run animation. You see that as the number of sides increases,

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
the polygon approaches the circumscribed circle. Of course in this case, you know that when you have

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
an infinite number of sides, then you get the area of the full circle, which is just π if the radius is 1.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay. On to the third problem for calculus, and that is what is called the velocity problem.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Here we have a particle that is moving along around a knotted curve. At each stage, you have the velocity

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and the acceleration, so you have the tangent and the normal, as we call it,

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and the problem might be to compute the velocity and acceleration at any time in a very accurate way.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Once again, you can use calculus for this.

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Finally, on to the problem of optimization. Let’s say a farmer has 500 feet of fencing available,

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and the farmer wants to fence off a rectangle with the maximum area. The question is

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
what should the dimensions of the rectangle be? Let’s look at this interactive model over here.

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You see that as you change the dimensions, you get more and more area. It increases up to certain point,

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and then it starts to shrink again. It would look like the best way to optimize over here would be

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
to choose a rectangle which is, in fact, a square of 125 feet by 125 feet, but the question is

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
how would you have arrived at the solution without trial and error?

61
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Calculus gives you a systematic way of solving such problems.

62
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Now of course the ancient Greeks knew quite a lot about solving such problems,

63
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
but it was only in the 17th century that mathematicians started to look a little deeper into

64
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
how one could solve each of these four problems. The French lawyer and mathematician Pierre de Fermat

65
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
developed a method for drawing tangents and finding maxima and minima.

66
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The clergymen John Wallis found ways, for example, to find the value of π/2 and do it quite accurately.

67
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Johannes Kepler, the great astronomer, used the method of the Greeks to find

68
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to find the volume of wine barrels, and in fact in doing so, he touched upon the questions of

69
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
finding volumes and finding maxima and minima, so he really is one of the pioneers of calculus.

70
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Of course at that point, geometry was still the method of choice for many problems,

71
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
so Isaac Barrow in England showed how to calculate the tangent to a curve

72
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
using purely geometrical means. So Fermat, Wallis, Kepler and Barrow were the early pioneers

73
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
of calculus, along with many others. Now you might read in books or elsewhere that

74
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Newton and Leibniz discovered calculus. The question is

75
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
in what sense are they regarded as pioneers and discovers of calculus in the true sense?

76
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The point is that although the early mathematicians knew about calculus one way or the other,

77
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
it was only Newton and Leibniz who gave general methods for doing calculus.

78
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
In fact, they put together all the earlier knowledge and found relations between

79
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
the various concepts of calculus. One question was who discovered calculus first?

80
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Was it Newton or Leibniz? Well, Leibniz published his paper first,

81
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:39,000
but then Newton had already shared his ideas on calculus with others. In England people said

82
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:49,000
oh, Newton discovered calculus, while elsewhere in Europe, the support was all for Leibniz.

83
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Well, today it doesn’t matter a lot, and we regard Newton and Leibniz as the joint creators of calculus,

84
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
for it was they who gave a unified way of looking at concepts in this subject to us,

85
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and today we talk of the Newton and Leibniz approach to calculus. Now beyond Newton–Leibniz,

86
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
people went on making improvements to calculus.

87
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The Bernoulli brothers were very active in this area. In fact, Johann Bernoulli wrote the first

88
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
the first differential calculus textbook informally; it was L’Hospital who actually published it.

89
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Maria Agnesi—lady mathematician—she was the eldest of 21 children, and still found time

90
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to do calculus and write a book that covered both differential and integral calculus.

91
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But the modern foundations of calculus, what made it really nice and precise,

92
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
were given by Cauchy and Weierstrass, and it was they who finally told us

93
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
how to approach calculus in a very rigorous and complete manner.

94
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Now although all these pioneers did a lot of work, things did not stop over there.

95
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Even today, we have calculus being used in many, many areas. For example, quantum mechanics,

96
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
which is the study of matter at the atomic level, uses the Schrӧdinger equation,

97
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:28,000
which is a product of calculus. If you go to financial markets, then the Black–Scholes equation is used

98
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
to find the prices of options. The Black–Scholes equation, in fact, uses what are called

99
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
partial differential equations. When Albert Einstein wanted to discover the laws of gravitation,

100
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
he had to turn to calculus, something called Ricci calculus, and his friend Marcel Grossmann

101
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
taught him the details, but Albert Einstein developed the so-called general theory of relativity

102
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
based on calculus. If you study economics and you want to study markets, you need calculus.

103
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If you want to study medicine, you need calculus to figure out dosing strategies.

104
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Of course even if you go to NASA, you would find that they use calculus all the time

105
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
to figure out how to design and how to propel their rockets. The point is calculus continues to be

106
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
a key tool in many different areas. But you might ask okay, that’s fine;

107
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
it’s really useful to some people, but why is it useful to me?

108
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Why should I study calculus? Well, I already gave the first reason. The first reason is that

109
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
it has very broad applications in the real world. The other point is a more practical one—

110
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
that if you are studying any kind of STEM degree in science or technology, then they would ask you

111
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
to first master calculus before doing anything else. It’s a prerequisite which you must go through

112
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
if you want to become a technical kind of person. Now on the other hand, you can say that

113
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I’m not going to go into any of these STEM fields; I just am going to pursue my own interests.

114
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, that’s fine, but for anyone to master calculus represents a major academic milestone

115
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
for that person, and to me, that is the main reason for studying calculus.

116
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It is a major academic milestone. If at any point in your career you can say I know calculus,

117
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
that is a great feeling, and I hope you get it after going through this course.

118
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay. A little bit about the course itself. This course will have 40 lessons—it’s a 40-part course,

119
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and roughly speaking, the course is based on the AP Calculus AB in this country, the US.

120
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The AP Calculus course is a pretty challenging high-school level course, and I thought that

121
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
it would be good to get more people into studying calculus early and preparing themselves

122
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
for applying it in their own careers. Now we’ll begin with standard topics like functions and limits,

123
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and having done that, we will move onto differential calculus and finally we will move on to integral calculus.

124
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Don’t worry if you don't follow these terms; they’ll get familiar to you a little later on.

125
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Of course the only way to learn calculus and mathematics is by doing, so there will be lots of

126
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
problem sessions and quizzes to help you understand calculus in a deeper and practical way.

127
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But the main point is that we will focus on understanding, and there will be almost no

128
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
formal proofs for any theorems, so the advantage of that is that we can focus on visualization,

129
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
on calculations, and really get familiar with all the things which are possible

130
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
possible with Mathematica and the Wolfram Language. I do hope you’ll take advantage of this course

131
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
to really understand fundamentals of calculus, how to compute things,

132
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
how to draw beautiful plots, et cetera, using the tools that are available to us today

133
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and were not even a few decades ago.

134
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Okay. Who is this course for? You might wonder is this course really for me?

135
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Am I old enough for it? Am I the right person? Well, it doesn’t matter who you are;

136
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
you will enjoy this course. You might be a beginner trying to learn calculus;

137
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
you’re welcome to the course. You might be a middle schooler, for example, who is ambitious

138
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and wants to learn calculus at a very early stage. That’s fine; you can learn it. This course is

139
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
a good place to begin. Or you might be a doctor or engineer who has learned calculus for sure earlier on,

140
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
but just wants to refresh their memory and learn this wonderful subject again.

141
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That’s fine; you’re welcome to. You’ll benefit something from this course.

142
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Now that’s specialized people, but really anyone who wants to understand the Wolfram Language

143
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and how it applies to calculus is going to find this course extremely beneficial. To me,

144
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
this course is designed to be for everyone, not any specialty group, and we’ll try and go slow

145
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and explain things very, very carefully at every stage. It’s a good point for me to mention that

146
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,000
this course arose in an internship project with John Clark. John Clark was with me last summer,

147
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and in fact, he was a student at some point at the California Institute of Technology.

148
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
John is a remarkable person. He learned calculus when he was in the 7th grade. He is a genius,

149
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and he did a great job producing the basic material for the course. But my point is that if John,

150
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
at his age having just finished college, could write the course, you can surely follow

151
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
what I’m saying over here. Do not give up. Keep persevering. The rewards will be immense.

152
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I strongly urge you to follow the course all the way through all 40 lessons,

153
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and you will have mastered calculus by the time we are done.

154
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay. Let’s summarize what we have learned today. As a piece of mathematics,

155
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
calculus shows us what we are capable of if we really put our minds to it.

156
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Whether Newton or Leibniz or Fermat or Maria Agnesi, these individuals took time off from

157
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
their daily duties to do what interests them most, which is mathematics and calculus,

158
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and that’s why we have this wonderful subject today. Even today, if you want to do

159
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
if you want to do any kind of science in the broadest sense, whether it’s physical science

160
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
or social science, you will find calculus is a very useful apparatus which has in fact

161
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
changed our whole view of the world. Now if you are a student, you will more or less

162
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
certainly at some stage have to do a little bit of calculus, and you should feel proud

163
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,000
to have mastered it yourself—beginning with this course, perhaps. That’s the introduction to calculus

164
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
which I have given you today, and in the next lesson, we will begin formally.

165
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It’s all going to be a little more serious and straightforward in some ways because

166
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
we will talk about functions and then slowly progress into the other areas of calculus.

167
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
With that summary, I will conclude today’s lesson. It’s been a pleasure to discuss

168
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
this introduction with you. I hope you have enjoyed a bit from it. Thank you very much.
