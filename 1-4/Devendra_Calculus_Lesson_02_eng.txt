00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 2 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The topic for this lesson is functions. Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Last time, we learned that calculus is all about change, so you can have changing speed

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
or changing volume, and then you can apply calculus to study such phenomena.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But a little more precisely, calculus is about quantities that change with respect to other quantities.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
For example, the distance traveled by a car changes with respect to time,

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
so you think of time as being an independent variable, and the distance depends upon the time taken.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Or the surface area of a cylinder varies with respect to the radius and the height of the cylinder.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What we need is a precise way of defining such changes, and that’s what we’ll do in this lesson.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We’ll show you how to do this using functions in the Wolfram Language. Let’s begin by

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
by defining a function, but before doing that, I need to speak about sets.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A set is a collection of objects. For example, you could talk of the set of even, positive numbers—

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, et cetera—and then an element of this set is an object that belongs to it.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
For example, 2 is an element of the even, positive numbers, while 3 is not an element of that set.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, a function is a rule that assigns to each element <i>x</i> in a set <i>X</i> exactly one element,

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
called <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], in a set <i>Y</i>. You think of them as being <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> as in this example.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You’ve got a function Sin[<i>x</i>], which is a trigonometric function, and its graph,

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
its plot is a wavy form, but the point here is that this <i>x</i> axis over here is the domain

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
of the function, and that is all the real numbers, while the function values over go between

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,000
−1 and 1, so that gives you the range of this function, −1 to 1, while the entire <i>y</i> axis

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:50,000
is called the codomain. You have a function, and then you have the domain, the codomain and its range.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The question is how do you do make such functions in the Wolfram Language?

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Here’s how we do it. We have a function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^2, so for every <i>x</i> over here,

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
it doesn’t matter what <i>x</i> is; you simply square that number or expression. For example,

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
<i>f</i>[2] is clearly 4. But you can also have a function that depends upon two variables, <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>,

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
so that’s like a pattern for <i>x</i> and that’s a pattern for <i>t</i>. Here’s a function <i>g</i>, and then you can

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
define the function and then find its values. The <i>g</i>[2, 3] is 33, so when <i>x</i> is 2 and <i>t</i> is 3,

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
then the value of the function is 33.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay. Another thing you might want to do with a function is to find what the graph

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
of the function looks like. The graph is just the set of all ordered pairs <i>x</i> and <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] for that function.

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You think of that as being pairs of <i>x</i>’s and <i>y</i>’s.

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Here is a plot of the function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^2 between 0 and 10, but you can also put in

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
<i>x</i>^2 directly over here in the Plot function and get back just the same result.

34
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay. The question now is how do you find the value of a function for other expressions?

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let’s say <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] is <i>x</i>^2. Then the value of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i> + 1] is (<i>x</i> + 1)^2, but you might want to

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
simplify that a little bit, so you can do Expand of the result and get back the expanded version.

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Or you can apply the Expand function a little later, and get back just the same result.

38
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Over here you’ve got a function <i>g</i>, and you can put <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> for <i>x</i>, and then expand

39
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and get back the result. Okay. The question is now in how many ways can you define a function?

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, first of all, you could use a table of values like over here.

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
There’s a function which squares a number, so 1^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, et cetera, and you get back

42
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
a function from this table of values. Or you could describe the graph of the function.

43
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This graph over here tells you that for every value of the side, you have side squared on the <i>y</i> axis.

44
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Or you could just use an algebraic formula and get the same function. Functions can be defined

45
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
in various ways depending on the situation and problem.

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Now here’s a practical example to put together what we’ve done so far.

47
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You want to find the cost of a metal box which has volume of 100 and whose height is twice its length,

48
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,000
given that the top and bottom cost $5 per square centimeter while the sides cost $8.

49
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay. The cost is going to be 5 times the top and bottom area plus 8 times the side area.

50
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That’s the cost function. Now you know the volume is length times width times height,

51
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and that’s the relationship given to you, height is twice the length, so you can plug that into

52
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
the equation for the volume and get back an expression for <i>w</i>, the width, in terms of the length.

53
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Once you’ve done that, then the entire cost of the box can be written in terms of <i>l</i>, the length.

54
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You can use that to compute the cost of the box when its length is 10 cm, and the answer is $3,410.

55
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay. Now in this example, if you look at the function for the box cost,

56
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
then you could plug in a length of −1. That still works, but of course that’s not a very meaningful length;

57
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
it’s a negative number. You could also try to plug in 0.

58
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This time, Mathematica and the Wolfram Language will certainly complain and tell you that

59
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
this is not allowed; it’s an indeterminate answer. We have a function called FunctionDomain

60
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
which will definitely try and isolate the problems for you. It says over here that

61
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the length of the box should either be negative or positive–not zero like over here—

62
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
but of course you know that in practice, negative lengths are not useful,

63
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
so you do need to use some common sense when you find the domain of a function.

64
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The context of the problem is everything.

65
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay. Let’s go on now and talk about how to decide whether something is a function.

66
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
A function, recall, has to give you exactly one element, <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], for every <i>x</i>.

67
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Here’s an example of a plot which is not a function, and why is that?

68
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Because for every number over here, you get back two numbers on the <i>y</i> axis.

69
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Every number between −1 and 1 gives you two numbers vertically. If you were to draw a vertical line,

70
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:34,000
then that vertical line will cut the plot at two points, and so this relation over here is not a function.

71
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The vertical line test is a very useful way of finding out whether a given plot gives a function or not.

72
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Having done all that, let’s now talk about all the different kinds of functions.

73
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
A very nice, simple kind of function is a piecewise function. For example, here is

74
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the real absolute value of <i>x</i>. The absolute value is a V-shaped function, but you could also use

75
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the built-in Piecewise function to do just the same thing. Piecewise will say that the value should be

76
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:19,000
−<i>x</i> for −<i>x</i>, and <i>x</i> otherwise. That’s the same function, but now defined manually

77
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,000
using Piecewise. Another kind of function that is quite useful in practice is a symmetric function.

78
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You can have an even function which has a plot that’s the same on the left and the right, so to speak.

79
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The value of <i>f</i>[−<i>x</i>] is the same as <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]. Or you can have an odd function in which the plot now looks like

80
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:58,000
it’s negative on the left and positive on the right in this case, so the value of <i>f</i>[−<i>x</i>] is −<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>].

81
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Finally, you could have a functions which increase or decrease.

82
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Here is the square function, and if you plot it, it first decreases, it goes down and then increases.

83
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But here’s an example of a much simpler function which neither increases or decreases;

84
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
it’s just nice and flat and constant. There are a wide range of functions in calculus,

85
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and each of them lets us solve different kinds of problems. That’s the end of the lesson.

86
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Just to summarize, functions tell us how quantities change with respect to other quantities.

87
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You can use either words or tables or graphs or formulas to define a function.

88
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If you’re given a graph, the question might be is this a function or not? Well, you can apply

89
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:06,000
the vertical line test. Then finally, functions can be piecewise or even or odd

90
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
or increasing or decreasing, and all kinds of other classifications, but all of them prove

91
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,000
to be useful in practice. In the next lesson, we’ll go over the basic functions which we require in calculus,

92
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
but before doing that, do review today’s lesson, go over the exercises and make sure you follow functions,

93
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
because they are at the very heart of calculus. Once you know functions,

94
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
you can begin the study of calculus. I’ll stop over here.

95
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I hope you enjoyed today’s lesson. Thank you.
