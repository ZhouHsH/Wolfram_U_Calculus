00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 3 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Our topic for today is the elementary functions. Let’s begin with a brief overview of today’s lesson.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In the previous lesson, Lesson 2, we learned how our functions can be used to represent change,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and we learned how to define a function, plot it, evaluate it, et cetera, but then we also learned that

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
there are many different kinds of functions. It’s quite puzzling, the number of functions you might see

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
at any one time. Here are a few graphs over here. Let’s say that’s a kind of oscillating function,

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and you might have an increasing function or a decreasing function, and the question is

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
what do you really need to study calculus in this course? Well, in this lesson what we’ll do is

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
we’ll categorize the types of functions that you’ll really encounter later in the course.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
These functions are somewhat simpler than what you might encounter in advanced mathematics,

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and hence they are called elementary functions, as opposed to what are called special functions.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Our topic of today is elementary functions, which we will study in some detail.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Perhaps the simplest kind of function is a linear function. For example, here is a function

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:36,000
<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i> + 3, and if you plot it, what you see is you get a straight line. That’s a linear function,

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and in general, the function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>mx</i> + <i>b</i> is called a linear function, and that <i>m</i> over there is the slope

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and the <i>b</i> is the <i>y</i>-intercept. Linear functions are rather simple. Their graphs are straight lines,

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
they have a slope and a <i>y</i>-intercept, and that’s about all.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay. To go a step further, let’s talk about power functions. A power function is also very simple.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It has a form <i>x</i> to the power <i>a</i>. Here are some power functions of a simple power

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,000
like 1 and 2 and 3 and 4. Let’s plot them, and what you notice is that the graphs depend upon

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the kind of power you have. If you have an odd degree or an odd power function,

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:41,000
then the graphs are odd. For example, the graph for <i>x</i> is odd, whereas the plot for <i>x</i>^2 will be even.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
These power functions are simple in the sense that the odd degree functions are odd

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and the even degree functions are even. Now slightly harder than those are the root functions,

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
where you have things like <i>x</i>^(1/2), like the square root function basically. That’s just a simple way

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That’s just a simple way of saying x^(1/3) in the Wolfram Language. Those functions are

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
are a little more complicated than the earlier set because now what happens is if you look at the plots,

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
they look a bit thicker over here than over there. That’s because the odd roots are defined everywhere

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
while the even ones are only defined for positive—or non-negative, really—values of the variable.

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Here’s the square root function, and the square root of a number is only defined

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:45,000
if the number is non-negative. That’s the class of power functions which are quite useful in practice.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
To go a step further, let’s talk about polynomials. That over there, the function <i>f</I>, is a polynomial.

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Now if you plot the polynomial, you get a graph. It’s a nice smooth graph, and generally speaking

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
if you want to find a polynomial, you need to set up a sum of this type. The <i>a</i>’s over here

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
are coefficients, while the powers are right over there—<i>n</i>, <i>n − 1</i>, et cetera.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The highest power is called the degree of the polynomial. This polynomial over here

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:36,000
has coefficients 3, −1, 7 and 6, while the degree is 4 because you have <i>x</i>^4 over there.

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
In particular, linear functions have degree 1, quadratic functions have degree 2

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and cubic functions have degree 3. You have this vast array of polynomials.

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
They are very simple to work with, but they are incredibly useful. You have linear, quadratic,

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
cubic polynomials, et cetera, which we encounter all the time in the course.

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay. To go a step further, we can talk about rational functions. A rational function is

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
simply a quotient of two polynomials, the ratio of two polynomials.

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If you divide a polynomial by another, you get a rational function. Perhaps the simplest kind

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
of rational function is the reciprocal function, which is 1/<i>x</i>. If you plot it,

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
you see the plot has got two pieces, and that’s because there is a problem at <i>x</i> = 0

47
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
where the function is not defined. You have a piece on the right and a piece on the left,

48
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and together they give you the reciprocal function. In general, rational functions

49
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
are defined everywhere, except where the denominator is zero. Whenever the function <i>q</i> over here is zero,

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you will find that there are problems and the rational function is not defined. But apart from that,

51
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
they are rather simple to work with, and again, they are incredibly useful in calculus.

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay. Let’s go a step further and talk about algebraic functions. An algebraic function

53
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
is obtained by adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing or taking roots,

54
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and that of course is where all the trouble lies because when you take roots, you can have

55
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
you can have all kinds of things going wrong. Here’s a pretty complicated algebraic function.

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It’s got square roots, cube roots, et cetera, in it, and if you plot it, there could be issues.

57
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There is an issue over here at zero because of the denominator, and then the function may

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
not be defined on certain parts, so the domain is rather small typically,

59
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and these algebraic functions come in a variety of shapes. Although they are interesting,

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
they are somewhat less easy to work with, and we will probably not use them a lot at the start.

61
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay. Beyond algebraic functions, we then have the trigonometric functions, which of course

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
many of you might be familiar with. The sine, cosine, and tangent functions are

63
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
the trigonometric functions. Now, just a word of warning. In the Wolfram Language,

64
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
we always use the radian measure. If I say Sin[30], that’s not so good; you have to say Sin[π/6]

65
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
or Sin[30 Degree] when you really want the sine of 30 degrees. Then of course you get

66
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Then of course you get the correct behavior. The 1/2’s over there came out because you used

67
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
the right notation and the right units. Keep in mind that you must always use the radian measure

68
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
when working in the Wolfram Language, or else you must say Degree like I have done over here.

69
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Here are the first three plots for trig functions: sine, cosine and tangent.

70
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay. You can see that they are all oscillating, both sine and cosine. Then the tangent function

71
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
has got these similarities because that’s where you have a problem: when you divide by zero,

72
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
the cosine function is zero, et cetera. Okay. Those are the sine, cosine and tangent functions,

73
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and sine and cosine have a period of 2π, while the tangent has a period of π only.

74
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They are repetitious and they have periods, but those periods depend upon the kind of function

75
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
you are working with. Of course you could have a Sin[2<i>x</i>], Sin[3<i>x</i>], et cetera,

76
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
to get faster and faster oscillations.

77
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay. Now if you take a reciprocal of the trigonometric functions, then you get

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
cosecant, secant and cotangent, which are the reciprocal trigonometric functions.

79
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Here are their graphs. What you see over here is that reciprocal graphs are right over there, and

80
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
the problem is that they are not defined wherever the corresponding trig function is 0.

81
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
For example, if sine happens to be zero at a point, then cosecant is not defined, et cetera,

82
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
so there are gaps in these functions which reflect the zeros of the underlying trigonometric function.

83
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But they are also somewhat similar to trig functions in the sense that secant and cosecant have

84
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
got a period of 2π while cotangent has got a period of π.

85
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
These functions are quite useful in some parts of calculus.

86
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay. Going a step further, we can now talk about the exponential functions,

87
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
which are of the form <i>a</i> raised to the power <i>x</i>, so now the exponent is variable.

88
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
For example, if we look at 2^<i>x</i>—that’s a case when the base <i>a</i> is greater than 1—

89
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
then you have an exponential growth function. Here’s a plot, and you can see quite clearly

90
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
that it is growing quite fast. On the other hand, if you take number between 0 and 1 like 0.5,

91
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
then you get a decreasing function. But in any case, these functions always pass through

92
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:17,000
the point (0, 1) because <i>a</i>^0 = 1, as you all know from your study of indices in algebra.

93
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Exponential functions are really useful for capturing growth on one hand and decay on the other.

94
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Things like our population might grow exponentially, and certain other things

95
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
might decay exponentially, but together, the exponential functions of different types give you

96
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
a powerful way of expressing rates of growth or decay in calculus.

97
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
They are incredibly important and you should know them well.

98
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Finally, we’ll talk about the logarithmic functions, which are defined as log[<i>x</i>] to base <i>a</i>,

99
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and they are the inverses of the exponential functions. Here is a graph of Log[<i>x</i>].

100
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Keep in mind that in the Wolfram Language, the base is set to <i>e</i>,

101
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
but if you want a different base, then you would say that over here and you would get back Log[<i>x</i>],

102
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
but now to the base 1/4. They are very similar in some sense to the exponential functions

103
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
because they are in fact the inverses. The logarithmic functions are quite useful, but as you can see,

104
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
they grow much slower than the exponentials and they have their own uses.

105
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Okay. We’ve talked about a fairly wide variety of elementary functions,

106
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and to summarize today’s lesson, we have many different forms of functions

107
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and many different kinds of graphs studied today. You can have linear functions,

108
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
polynomial functions, rational functions, trig functions, et cetera, and together they already required

109
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
for studying calculus in this course, for the most part.

110
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Okay. We are basically done with today’s lesson. In the next lesson we will cover limits,

111
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
so you really start doing calculus in this course next time. But before doing that,

112
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
do look at today’s lesson in the notebook that’s supplied to you, look at the accompanying exercises,

113
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
go over them. You can only learn mathematics by doing, so spend some time reviewing,

114
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
solve the exercises, et cetera, and you should be in good shape to join me next time for Lesson 4.

115
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Thank you very much. I hope you enjoyed today’s lesson. I’ll see you next time.
