00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 4 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The topic for today’s lesson is the limit of a function, and it is today that we begin formally

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the study of calculus in this course. The limits are an essential topic in any calculus course.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let’s begin with an overview of the topic.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Here are two simple plots. I’m going to plot <i>x</i> from −1 to 1. That is of course just a straight line,

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and then I’m going to plot <i>x</i>^2/<i>x</i> in the same limits, and I again get back what looks like

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
essentially the same straight line. On the other hand, if we look at the function <i>x</i>^2/<i>x</i>,

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
then strictly speaking it’s not defined when <i>x</i> is 0 because you’re doing 0/0,

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and that becomes clearer if we define a function <i>g</i> with that expression. <i>g</i> over here

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
is defined to be <i>x</i>^2/<i>x</i>, and if you try to find the value of <i>g</i> at 0, then you get back

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the value indeterminate. The Quiet over only says that I would not like to see

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
any warnings that Wolfram Language would give us in this case.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay. The point is you have two very similar functions, but the second one has a slight issue at 0.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Now even though it is not defined at 0, you still would like to know what the behavior

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
of the function is near this point, and that’s what limits are all about. They are about tracking

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
the behavior of a function near a point. The mathematical way of doing this is called a limit.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Here’s an example to show the notion of a limit. Let’s take <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^2 − <i>x</i> + 2.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Again, you want to find the behavior of this function as <i>x</i> approaches a certain value.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let’s say you want to focus on the value <i>x</i> = 1 and you make a table over here.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Don’t worry too much about how to make the table; that’s not too important for us.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
As you take values close to 1, you begin from 0 and go up to 1—very close to 1, but not 1 itself—

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
you see the values get close to 2. Just same thing happens from the right, that the value is

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
very close to 2 when you are close to 1. It appears that this function gets closer and closer to 2

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:45,000
as the values of <i>x</i> grow closer and closer to 1 from both the sides. One would then say that

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the limit of this function when <i>x</i> approaches 1 is 2. Limits are just

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
a way of showing the behavior of a function near a point, but not necessarily at that point.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay. Some examples. Let’s begin with a function which is a trigonometric function divided by

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
a simple polynomial. It’s a trigonometric rational function, and you want to find

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the limit of this function as <i>x</i> approaches 0. If you look over here at the table, it’s clear that

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
as you approach 0 from either side, the values approach 1. In fact if you plot the function,

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
you get the same kind of guess that the value of the limit seems to be 1. The table says 1,

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the plot says 1, but in practice it’s best to use the Limit function in Wolfram Language,

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,000
which tells you the limit is actually 1. Tables are good, plots are better, but Limit is the best.

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Limit will always tell you exactly what the limit of a function is at a point.

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The whole theme of our discussion will be try to move towards using Limit whenever you can.

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
As my second example, let’s take a rational function. That’s a rational function.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It’s a polynomial divided by a polynomial. Now notice that when <i>x</i> is plus or minus 1,

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
there’s a problem with the denominator becoming 0. Let’s say you want to talk about

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
the behavior near −1. Near −1, it looks like the values are very close to −0.5.

40
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Now let’s plot the function, and it does look like when you are close to −1,

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
the values are close to −0.5. It looks like the function approaches −1/2 as an exact number

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
as <i>x</i> approaches −1. You can confirm that with Limit and get back that value as the actual limit.

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay. As my next example, let’s consider this piecewise function <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>].

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Now the piecewise part over here is all simple. It’s just −0.75 at <i>x</i> = −1,

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and it’s the same rational function as before everywhere else. Now if you make a table of values,

46
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
it’s clear that as long as you stay away from −1, then there’s no problem at all

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and the values approach −0.5 as before. Here’s a plot which shows that there’s a problem

48
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
at just a single point, −1, but everywhere else, things are just the same as before.

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
In fact, the limit does seem to be −0.5. Let’s confirm that over here, and you do get back −0.5

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
for this piecewise function limit.

51
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Now, let’s go on to a slightly more complicated example; namely, an algebraic function.

52
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Here’s an algebraic function. It’s got a square root in it and the denominator <i>x</i>^2, so when <i>x</i> is 0,

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
that’s a problem. But fortunately everything is removable in the sense that

54
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
there really is no problem at 0. In fact, if we make a table of values, you see that

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
when you are very close to 0, the value is very close to 0.25. You plot the function,

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and you see that the value at 0 does seem to approach 0.25. You can confirm the answer with Limit,

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and you get back the value 0.25 as an exact number, 1/4.

58
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay. Let’s go on now to a slightly more tricky function. Here is a trigonometric function.

59
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now if we make a table of values over here, what you see is that the values all seem to be 1 mostly.

60
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It looks like there is a problem because the limit seems to be 1. Intuition tells you that

61
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
this might be more complicated, so let’s plot. Then you do that. You see it is much more wiggly.

62
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It’s much more complicated. What you need to take away from this is that

63
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
tables are useful, but they are not terribly reliable. The plot says that this limit

64
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
probably does not exist, but in fact you can confirm the answer with Limit, and check that

65
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the answer is actually indeterminate. Indeterminate says that this limit does not exist.

66
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay. Let’s move on now to a slightly more complicated function, and hopefully you realize by now

67
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
that we do need some different ways of finding limits. But just for now,

68
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
let’s take the same approach and make a table of values over here.

69
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When you make a table of values and you are close to 0, you see the values

70
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:53,000
seem to approach 0.015 on either side. As an exact number, you would expect

71
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the limit to be around 3/200. You plot the function. The limit does look like 0.015 at 0.

72
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You can confirm the answer with Limit and get back the correct result, which is 3/200.

73
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That’s the value of the limit function. It will tell you exactly what the limit is at a point.

74
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay. Having talked about limits, it’s convenient sometimes to talk about one-sided limits.

75
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Here’s an example where you have a piecewise function, and if you plot it, you see that

76
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:41,000
when you approach the point 0 from the left, the answer is −1. When you approach it from the right,

77
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the limit seems to be 1. The question is how do you check that with the Limit function?

78
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Well, we have an option called Direction, so when you say Direction→“FromBelow”,

79
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you’re going from the left; when it’s Direction→“FromAbove”, you’re going from the right.

80
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,000
When you do that, you see that you get back the values −1 and 1 respectively. Of course because

81
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
you don’t have the same behavior on the left and right, you get back indeterminate

82
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
as the answer for the limit. One-sided limits are really quite useful because they let you

83
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
analyze more and more complicated functions.

84
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Here is a piecewise function. It’s got several pieces. Notice that when you plot the function,

85
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
then there are three values of interest to us: there’s 1, there’s 4 and there’s 6.

86
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Now 4 is not a problem at all; it’s nice over there. At 1, it’s almost okay, except that

87
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
you have a slight piece outside of the point over here given by this piecewise component.

88
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
At 6, you have a slightly more difficult problem because you actually have a jump.

89
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It would look like when you approach 1, the value must be 3 for the limit. That’s 3 over here.

90
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
When you approach 4, the answer must be 6. That looks clear as well. Now when you approach 6 itself,

91
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
the limit does not seem to exist, and you can confirm this by using the Limit function.

92
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Now this strange thing over here is what we call a Map function, which actually lets you find

93
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
the values of the limits at different points in one stroke. You can confirm that at 6 you actually have

94
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
separate limits on the right and left by doing the direction computation,

95
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and you get back different answers, so surely the limit does not exist at <i>x</i> = 6.

96
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay. Now we need to turn in a slightly different direction and talk about infinite limits.

97
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Here’s an example where you have a rational function, and what you want to do is to use

98
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
a table of values that’s given to you to try and guess what the limit might be at the point <i>x</i> = −1.

99
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Here’s the table, and what you see is that when they approach −1 on the left or right,

100
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the values seem to blow up—they become infinite—but they become negatively infinite

101
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
on one side and positively infinite on this side. You can confirm that with the Limit function.

102
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You see that the values become −∞ on one side and ∞ on the other,

103
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and you can check that the limit does not exist, finally. Now we are talking about infinite limits,

104
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and that leads us to the concept of an asymptote. What’s an asymptote? It’s a point in the graph

105
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
where things become infinite. Here’s an example. You’ve got 1/(<i>x</i> − 1)^2 as a function,

106
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and whether you approach it at 1 from the left or right, the value becomes infinitely large

107
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
in a positive sense, and you can confirm that with a plot to check

108
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
the limit is actually going to be ∞ on either side. Well, if it’s infinite on either side, it is ∞,

109
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,000
so Limit says yes, the limit is ∞ at 1. That’s what we call a vertical asymptote.

110
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It’s a kind of vertical line that shows you that the function will become infinite

111
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
on both sides, in this case.

112
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But it can also have slightly different behavior. Here’s <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = 1/<i>x</i>, and if you plot it between −1 and 1,

113
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,000
then at 0 you have a different behavior on the left and the right—so on the right, it approaches ∞;

114
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
on the left, it approaches −∞, and you can confirm that with Limit. You see the limit does not exist,

115
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and what you have is a vertical asymptote of a slightly different kind.

116
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Okay. The question is how do you find asymptotes in general? Well, that’s really a hard problem,

117
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
but let’s say if I give you a cotangent function and I said find the asymptotes between −2π and 2π,

118
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
what you could do is make a plot of the function. The plot seems to say that there are

119
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
problems at 0—you can see over here—and then at π and then at 2π, et cetera. Let’s look at 0.

120
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You see that the function values are −∞ and ∞ from the two sides, so you certainly have

121
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,000
a vertical asymptote at 0, and just the same thing happens at all the other multiples of π.

122
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You can see that the limit does not exist at any of those points. Given a function,

123
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
you could try to plot it and then use Limit to figure out where the asymptotes might be.

124
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Okay. Finally I have an example in which you actually do need to use tables.

125
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Here is an example in which you have two variables. You have got an <i>h</i> and an <i>x</i>.

126
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Now the problem is that because <i>x</i> is not known to you, you cannot graph the function,

127
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:30,000
so graphing will get you nowhere in this case. But what you could do is make a table of values,

128
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and then what you see is—well, roughly speaking—if you expand it out, you get <i>x</i>^2 + 2<i>xh</i> + <i>h</i>^2 − <i>x</i>^2.

129
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If you do a bit of algebra, it will be clear to you that what is going to get left over is just 2<i>x</i>.

130
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Right. The point over here is the limit over here is just going to be 2<i>x</i>.

131
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Okay. We’ve seen now that tables are quite useful in some cases,

132
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
but in general, you should try and avoid them.

133
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That brings me to the end of today’s lesson. What you’ve learned is that the limits are a good way of

134
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
figuring out what happens as a function approaches a certain value of <i>x</i>.

135
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Now the function doesn’t even need to be defined at the point at which you want to find the limit,

136
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
but as long as the right-hand limit and the left-hand limit both exist, you are fine.

137
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
For a limit to exist, you must have the right-hand limit and the left-hand limit to be equal.

138
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
They could both be infinite, but they must both be equal. As you saw in the last example,

139
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
tables are really useful in some cases, but in general, you want to avoid using them,

140
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and you really want to use the Limit function. In the next lesson, we’ll talk the laws of limits,

141
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
which actually let you do limit computations very efficiently without using tables.

142
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But before we do that, I recommend that you go over today’s lesson and carefully master all the details

143
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
from the notebook, look at the exercises and make sure you understand

144
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
the notion of a limit really well before we actually start computing them at a really fast pace.

145
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That’s all I have to say for today’s lesson on the limit of a function. I hope you enjoyed it.

146
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I hope you really benefit from this first introduction to calculus with limits,

147
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and I’ll see you next time. Thank you.
