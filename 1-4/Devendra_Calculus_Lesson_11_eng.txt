00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 11 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The topic for this lesson is the chain rule, so let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Recall that if you have two functions <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>, then the composition of <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> will

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
take the values of <i>g</i> and then plug them into <i>f</i>. Here’s an example. You have <i>f</i> given by <i>x</i>^2,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and <i>g</i> is just a sine function. If you try and work out <i>f</i>[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]], that’s going to be Sin[<i>x</i>]

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and then the square of it, so Sin[<i>x</i>], the whole squared, or sine squared <i>x</i>.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now, the rules we have discussed so far—the sum rule, product, et cetera—cannot be used to find

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the derivatives of such compositions, but of course D knows about them.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What’s required over here is something called the chain rule. The chain rule is what lets you

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
find out the derivatives of compositions, and that’s the topic for the lesson:

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the chain rule and examples for this very powerful rule.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let’s begin with a statement of the rule. If you have two functions <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and if <i>f</i> is differentiable at <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>] and <i>g</i> is differentiable at <i>x</i>, then the composition is also

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
differentiable at <i>x</i>. The main point now is that the derivative is given by <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>] on the right

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and <i>f</i>'[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]] on the left. Here’s an example in the abstract setting. <i>D</i>[<i>f</i>[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]] is <i>f</i>'[<I>g</i>[<i>x</i>]] times <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>].

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So, if I said find the derivative of Sin^2[<i>x</i>], you would first work out the derivative of Sin[<i>x</i>]

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and then the derivative of <i>x</i>^2, and then would plug in <i>x</i> with Sin[<i>x</i>]. Okay.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Then you get back the answer 2Cos[<i>x</i>]Sin[<i>x</i>]. Here’s a plot of the function and its derivative,

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and notice that the function Sin^2[<i>x</i>] is always non-negative, but its derivative can be

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
either positive or negative depending upon which portion of the graph you are in.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay. As an example of an algebraic function with a composition in it, let’s take

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
the square root of <i>x</i>^2 − 1. Now in this case, the inner function is going to be <i>x</i>^2 − 1,

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and the outer one is square root of <i>x</i>, so that’s the composition in this case, <i>g</i>[<i>h</i>[<i>x</i>]].

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What you do is you work out the derivative of <i>x</i>^2 − 1, which is 2<i>x</i>, and then work out

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the derivative of the outer function, and there’s the answer. D gives the same result,

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and here is a plot of the function and its derivative. Of course because we’re finding

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
the derivative of the square root of <i>x</i>^2 − 1, there’s nothing on the left of 1 over here.

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay. Here’s a trig function, Cos[<i>x</i>^2]. Now the inner function over here is <i>x</i>^2;

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
the outer one is Cos[<i>x</i>]. Let’s first set up the composition, and you get back Cos[<i>x</i>^2] from <i>g</i>[<i>h</i>[<i>x</i>]].

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You work out the derivative of <i>h</i>. That’s 2<i>x</i>. Work out the derivative of <i>g</i>,

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and then that’s the answer. And of course, D gives just the same result.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Here is a plot of the function and its derivative.

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let’s go on now to talking about the power rule. Now, the power rule is a rule for finding

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the derivative of <i>x</i>^<i>n</i>, but you can make it even more powerful by just composing it

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
with another function <i>g</i>. Okay. If I gave you <i>f</i>[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]] with <i>g</i> being some function,

36
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:43,000
then the chain rule says that the derivative is <i>ng</i>[<i>x</i>]^(−1 − <i>n</i>)<i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>]. For example, if I said

37
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
find the derivative of (<i>x</i>^4 + 1)^100, you can find it quite easily because all you do is

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:01,000
you do 100 times that raised to 99 times the derivative of (<i>x</i>^4 + 1), which is 4<i>x</i>^3.

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Of course, you don’t have to use a positive here. You could use a fraction like in this example,

40
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
or you could even use a negative number, and you get back the answer quite easily.

41
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
In this very simple way, you can extend the power rule

42
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to find the derivatives of fairly complicated compositions.

43
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay. Now if you have a product like over here—<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] is a product of two things over here:

44
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
(3<i>x</i> − 2)^3 and (9<i>x</i>^4 − <i>x</i> +3)^5. You might think that the best way to do it is to expand <i>f</i>.

45
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Well, you could do that and then find the derivative, but that’s going to be a long, messy answer,

46
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
so a much better way is to use the product rule and the chain rule together.

47
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You say first function times the derivative of the second one, and then the second function times

48
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the derivative of the first, and you get back the answer, which is the same as

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the earlier long answer. In fact, D prefers to use the product rule,

50
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and of course you should do that too. Given a fairly complicated expression like this,

51
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
you must try and use the best rules possible to get the most compact answer in the result

52
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
because then you can use it much more easily in future work.

53
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay. Let’s go on now to talking about multiple compositions. The chain rule itself

54
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
talks about the derivative of <i>f</i>[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]] as being <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>] times <I>f</i>'[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]], but of course that will hardly be

55
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
a chain which only has two links in it, so you can keep on this way and build up chains

56
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
of longer and longer lengths. Let’s say that we’ve got <i>f</i>[<i>g</i>[<i>h</i>[<i>x</i>]]] like over here.

57
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The derivative is going to be <i>h</i>'[<i>x</i>] and then <i>g</i>'[<i>h</i>[<i>x</i>]] and then <i>f</i>'[<i>g</i>[<i>h</i>[<i>x</i>]]]. In every case,

58
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
you fix the remaining functions or variables and work out derivative. For example, if I gave you

59
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Sin[Cos[<i>x</i>^2]] as your function, then the derivative would be 2<i>x</i> from the <i>x</i>^2, then −Sin[<i>x</i>^2]

60
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
from the cosine and then Cos[Cos[<i>x</i>^2]] from the outer sine wave. The answer over here

61
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
is confirmed by D, and that tells you that given any long chain of compositions,

62
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
you can apply just the same rule and get the result.

63
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
A similar example is one I’ll take up next, which is CubeRoot[Cos[<i>x</i>^2]].

64
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Again, you start from the innermost function, <I>x</i>^2, then work out the next function derivative

65
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:27,000
in the chain and then the outermost derivative. The answer over here is a fairly complicated function,

66
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,000
but D confirms that it is correct. You can plot the function and its derivative, and you get back

67
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
this beautiful plot. Just to recall for you the procedure again, you work out the derivative of <i>x</i>^2,

68
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
the innermost one, work out the derivative of Cos[<i>x</i>] and replace <i>x</i> with <i>x</i>^2, and then finally

69
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
work out the derivative of CubeRoot[<i>x</i>] and replace <i>x</i> with Cos[<i>x</i>^2].

70
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay. As a final example, let’s talk about simple harmonic motion.

71
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Simple harmonic motion is a motion that’s given by the scale of a trigonometric function.

72
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Here <i>A</i> is the amplitude. Think about a pendulum. The amplitude is how far it goes in one direction.

73
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:29,000
ω is the frequency—that is, how fast it goes—and δ is the phase shift. You could have two pendulums

74
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and they both have drastic different motions because they have different phase shifts.

75
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
They started, say, at different times and you get different phase shifts.

76
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Now given such a simple harmonic motion, you can work out the velocity and the acceleration

77
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
by working out the first and second derivatives. Here are the velocity and acceleration,

78
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:06,000
<i>v</i> and <i>A</i>, and notice that the acceleration is almost the same as the position except that

79
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
it has this − ω^2 multiplied to it as an extra factor. What that says

80
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:26,000
is that <i>s</i>'' +  ω^2<i>s</i>[<i>t</i>] is equal to 0, and that’s something called a differential equation,

81
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
which you will study much later in calculus. The HoldForm does the following.

82
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It prevents anything from evaluating, so if you do ReleaseHold like I’ve done over there,

83
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
then in fact you get back the result True, which says that the differential equation is satisfied by

84
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
the simple harmonic motion function over here.

85
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of today’s lesson. To summarize, the chain rule lets you

86
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
find the derivatives of many more functions because you can work out

87
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
the derivatives of products and powers, et cetera, much more easily with the help of this rule.

88
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Now of course you can build up a chain of any length so you can use it more than once

89
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
where a function is a composition of more than two functions. Those two statements

90
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
summarize the lesson, but today’s lesson is probably the most difficult one in our series so far,

91
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
so do review it carefully, look at the exercises and make sure you’re ready for the next lesson,

92
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
which is on implicit differentiation. I’ll stop over here.

93
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I hope you enjoyed listening. Thank you.
