00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 13 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好 欢迎来到Wolfram U的微积分入门课程第13课

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is rates of change in the sciences.
本节课的主题是科学相关的变化率

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.
首先 我们先来简单介绍一下本课的内容

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let’s say you have a particle which moves along a straight line, for example.
比如说 有一个沿着直线运动的粒子

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The position at time <i>t</i> is given by this function <i>s</i>[<i>t</i>] that’s <i>t</i>^3 + 2<i>t</i> – 2.
<i>t</i>时刻的粒子位置由函数<i>s</i>[<i>t</i>]给出 <i>t</i>^3 + 2<i>t</i> - 2

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now once you have the position as a function of time, what you can do is to compute the derivative,
一旦获得位置关于时间的函数 就可以计算导数

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and then that will give you the velocity of the particle at time <i>t</i>. Here’s velocity. That’s 3<i>t</i>^2 + 2.
然后就可以得到粒子在<i>t</i>时刻的速度 粒子的速度是3<i>t</i>^2+2

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Once you have both <i>s</i> and <i>v</i>, you can then work out their values at any time. For example,
一旦获得<i>s</i>和<i>v</i> 就可以计算出任意时刻它们的值 例如

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:02,000
at <i>t</i> = 10, the values are 1,018 and 302. Having done that, you can also plot
<i>t</i>=10时 <i>s</i>和<i>v</i>分别为1,018和302 完成这些以后 还可以绘制

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the position and velocity as a function of time over a certain period of time—in this case, from 0 to 20. 
一段时间内 位置和速度关于时间的函数图像 作为例子 这里给出的是时间为0-20的图像

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
In this very simple example, you see that the derivative gives you
在这个非常简单的例子中 可以发现导数是

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
a nice way of approaching a problem in mechanics. What we’ll do in this lesson is
一种解决力学问题很好的方法 这节课我们要做的是

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
to explore the applications of differential calculus in the sciences in various different ways.
探讨微分学在科学领域中各种不同应用

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let’s again take up an example in mechanics where you have the position being given as a function of time like over here. 
让我们再举一个力学中的例子 在这个例子中 给定了如此所示的位置关于时间的函数

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You could work out the velocity of course as the first derivative,
可以通过求一阶导数 求出速度

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
but you could also work out the acceleration, which is the second derivative.
也可以通过求二阶导数 计算出加速度

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Once we have done that, we could ask questions. For example, you could ask
完成了以上这些 我们可以得知

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
when is the particle at rest? Well, it’s at rest when the velocity is 0. You could solve that equation
粒子何时处于静止状态？当速度为0时 粒子处于静止状态 通过求解这个方程

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and find out that the particle is at rest when <i>t</i> is either 2/3 or 2. Then you can plot the position,
可以得出当<i>t</i>为2/3或2时 粒子处于静止状态 接下来可以绘制位置

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
the velocity and the acceleration and get their graphs. You see that the position is given by the blue graph over here.
速度和加速度的图像 位置函数对应是这条蓝色曲线

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The velocity is the graph over there, and it clearly intersects the time axis at around 2/3 and 2. 
而速度是另一条曲线 速度曲线与时间轴的交点大概在2/3和2的位置

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The acceleration is a linear function of time.
而加速度是关于时间的线性函数

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The derivative is a very powerful way of studying problems in mechanics.
导数是研究力学问题的一种有力方法

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let’s go on to another example where let’s say you want to talk about the linear density of a rod.
我们再来看看另一个例子 讨论棒的线密度问题

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now if you have a rod and, let’s say, it’s got mass <i>m</i> and a certain length,
假如你有一根棒 它有质量<i>m</i>和一定的长度

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
then the average linear density is simply the mass divided by the length.
那么平均线密度就是质量除以长度

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But of course what could happen is that the mass of the rod depends upon how far down you are on it.
但情况可能是 棒的质量取决于与其长度

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let’s say the mass might be the cube root of the length, and in that case,
比方说 棒的质量可能是长度的立方根 这样的话

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you can talk about the linear density at a given length <i>l</i>. That is given by the derivative of the mass with respect to <i>l</i>. 
可以讨论其在给定长度<i>l</i>位置处的线密度 由质量关于长度<i>l</i>函数的导数给出

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:37,000
In this case, it’s 1/(3³√(<i>l</i>^2)). Then of course you can work out the linear density
在这种情况下 线密度为1/(3³√(< i>l</i>^2)) 自然就可以计算出任意给定位置的线密度

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
at any given length. In this case, if the length is 10, the answer is about 0.07.
在这个例子中 长度为10处的线密度约为0.07

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Then you can plot both the mass and the linear density. You see that 
接下来 可以绘制质量和线密度的图像 你会发现 

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
the mass sort of has constant increase, but the linear density goes down as the length increases
质量在不断增加 而随着长度的增加 线密度会下降

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
because of this expression for the derivative.
根据导数的表达式

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay. Let’s go on now to current. If you have, let’s say, a wire
好的 接下来讨论电流问题 假如现在有一根电线

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and some current flows through it, then the average current is the charge that flows in a certain period of time. 
电流流过电线 那么 平均电流就是一段时间内流过的电荷数

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But of course the charge itself might depend upon the time <i>t</i> like over here, 
但同时 正如这里所示 电荷本身也可能取决于时间<i>t</i>。

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and then the current at any given instant will be the derivative of that charge with respect to <i>t</i>. 
那么 任意给定时刻的电流是 电荷关于<i>t</i>的函数的导数

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
At, let’s say, one second, the current is 4 amperes.
比方说 时间为一秒时刻的电流是4安培

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Then what you can do is to plot the charge and the current and get back a plot for both these quantities.
接下来你可以绘制电荷和电流关于时间的图像 得到以下两个曲线图

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let’s go on now to chemistry. Now in chemistry, one talks about reactions—chemical reactions.
接下来讨论化学问题 化学问题中 常谈论的对象是化学反应

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What happens there is that one or more reactants would undergo some process
化学反应中 一种或多种反应物经历一些过程

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and give you some products.  For example, you might have two reactants <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>
生成一些产物 例如 有两种反应物< i>A</i>和< i>B</i>。

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that give you a product <i>C</i>. One talks about the concentration of any of these in moles per liter.
产物<i>C</i> 要讨论的是任何一种物质的浓度 浓度以摩尔/升为单位

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That concentration is of course a function of time as time goes by. For example, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> might decrease in quantity
显然 浓度是关于时间的函数 例如 <i>A</i>和<i>B</i>数量上可能减少

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and <i>C</i> might go up. In that case, the rate of reaction at an instant is given by 
而<i>C</i>可能上升 在这个例子中 某一时刻的反应速率由以下函数给出

47
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
the derivative of the concentration with respect to <i>t</i>. For example,
函数是浓度关于<i>t</i>的函数的导数 例如

48
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
suppose that the concentration of <i>C</I> is given by 3<i>t</i>/(3<i>t</i> + 1). Then the rate of reaction at any given time
假设<i>C</I>的浓度由3<i>t</i>/(3<i>t</i>+1)给出 那么给定时刻的反应速率

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
is a derivative, so it’s 3/(1 + 3<i>t</i>)^2. Then what you can do is to plot both these quantities,
是一个导数值 反应速率的表达式为3/(1+3<i>t</i>)^2 那么现在能把这两个量的变化曲线绘制出来

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and you see that as time goes by, the concentration will increase, but of course
可以发现 随着时间的推移 浓度上升

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the rate of reaction will go down as the system approaches a steady state.
而当系统接近稳定状态时 反应速率将下降

52
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay. Let’s go on now to biology. In biology, one talks about population models.
好的 接下来讨论的是生物问题 生物学会讨论种群模型

53
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
For example, the population at time <i>t</i> might be given by 2<i>t</i>^3 + <i>t</i>, and in that case,
例如 <i>t</i>时刻的种群数量由2<i>t</i>^3+<i>t</i>给出 在这种情况下

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
the growth rate for that population is the derivative of that population with respect to <i>t</i>.
种群数量的增长率是种群数量关于<i>t</i>的导数

55
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
In this case, it’s just 6<i>t</i>^2 + 1. Then of course you can plot both the population and the growth rate like we’ve done over here. 
即6<i>t</i>^2+1 接下来就可以如此所示 绘制人口和增长率的变化曲线

56
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In practice, one might have a slightly different model.
实践中 可能存在不同的模型

57
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
For example, if you talk about the growth of bacteria, then it might happen that
例如 谈到细菌的生长 细菌数量可能会

58
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the population doubles every minute, for example, in which case
每分钟翻一番 在这种情况下

59
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
you might get a formula like the initial population times 2^<i>t</i>,
可以得到以下公式 初始数量乘以2^< i>t</i>。

60
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and that’s what is called an exponential function.
这就是所谓的指数函数

61
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay. Finally, let’s go on to economics. In economics, one talks about the cost function.
好的 最后 我们来讨论经济学问题 经济学中会研究成本函数

62
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Let’s say a company might talk about its cost function, which is a total cost of producing <i>x</i> units.
比方说 一家公司可能会研究其成本函数 即生产<i>x</i>单位产品的总成本

63
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Here’s a cost function in a particular case. Now if you find the derivative of the cost function,
以下是一种特定情况下的成本函数 求出该成本函数的导数

64
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,000
then that’s what is called the marginal cost. The marginal cost, roughly speaking,
得到所谓的边际成本 边际成本 粗略地来说

65
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,000
is the amount of money it costs to produce an extra unit. For example, you might ask
是再生产一个单位产品的成本 例如 可能想知道

66
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,000
what is the marginal cost and the actual cost of producing the 1,001st unit?
生产第1,001个单位产品的边际成本和实际成本是多少？

67
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That’s going to be the derivative of the cost at that value, or you could actually find it
边际成本是成本在该值下的导数值 或者

68
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
by subtracting off the cost in both the cases, so 1,001 – 1,000. You see that they are very close,
可以通过生产1001和1000个单位的两个成本间相减 计算得到实际成本 可见 二者非常接近

69
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
but not quite the same. The marginal cost gives you a very good estimate of the cost to produce an extra unit. 
但又不完全相同 边际成本为额外生产一个单位产品所需成本提供了一个非常好的估计

70
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Once again, you can plot everything over here,
同样地 你可以绘制

71
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
the cost and the marginal cost, to get those two plots.
成本和边际成本的曲线 得到这两张图像

72
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of this lesson. The main point is that derivatives are used
好 这节课到此就要结束了 这节课的重点是 导数

73
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
universally in the sciences. If you’re a physicist, you might use them to study motion.
在科学领域被广泛使用 如果你是物理学家 你可能会使用导数研究运动

74
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If you’re a chemist, you might use them to study reaction rates, but if you’re a biologist,
如果你是化学家 你可能会使用导数研究反应速率 又如果你是生物学家

75
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you might use them to study growth rates. Finally, it’s not just the natural sciences,
你可以用导数来研究种群增长率 最后 不仅仅是自然科学

76
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
but also the social sciences. In economics, you might use derivatives to find the marginal cost.
在社会科学中 导数的应用也十分广泛 在经济学中 你可能会使用导数求解边际成本

77
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Of course, there are many more uses of derivatives that we haven’t spoken about in this lesson,
当然 导数的用途还有非常多 这节课都没有讲到

78
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
but you will learn them as time goes by. The key point is that wherever the quantity is changing,
但随着时间的推移 你会逐渐了解 关键的一点是 凡是数量在变化

79
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,000
derivatives will play a key role. That brings me to the end of today’s lesson.
导数就能发挥关键作用 这节课到此结束

80
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The next lesson will talk about related rates, but before we do that, please review today’s lesson,
下一节课将讨论相关变化率 在此之前 请大家先回顾一下今天的课程

81
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
go over the exercises and make sure that you understand them really well
完成练习 确保你真正理解了本课内容

82
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
because derivatives are very important in sciences, and it’s important that you understand how they can be used. 
原因是导数在科学领域至关重要 你必须要了解如何使用导数

83
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I’ll stop over here. I hope you have enjoyed listening.
这节课就到这里 希望你听得开心

84
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Thank you.
谢谢！
