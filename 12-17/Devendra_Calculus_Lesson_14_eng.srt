00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 14 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好 欢迎来到Wolfram U的微积分入门课程第14课

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The topic for this lesson is related rates.
本节课的主题是相关变化率

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson. In most problems,
首先 我们先来简单介绍一下本课的内容 在大多数问题中

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
there will be more than one thing that is changing in relation to something else. For example,
通常 有不止一个事物与其他事物的关系 在不断发生变化 例如

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
you might have—of course time varies, but then two other things vary with time.
你可能会碰到 时间不同时 两样东西都随着时间发生变化的情况

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
As a good instance of that, let’s talk about a ladder that’s falling along a side of a wall.
作为一个很好的例子 我们来讨论沿着墙一侧滑落的梯子

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That’s the ladder. It’s falling along the wall, and there are two things that are changing:
梯子沿着墙壁滑落 有两样东西在变化

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
there’s the height of the ladder from the top and the distance from the base of the ladder to the base of the wall. 
分别是 梯子从上到下的高度和梯子从底部到墙壁的距离

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Both of these are changing as the ladder falls.
这两个长度都会随着梯子的滑落而变化

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Of course, the rate at which the height is dropping and the rate at which the distance is increasing are related. 
当然 高度减小的速率和距离增加的速率之间是相关联的

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That’s the theme for today’s lesson: related rates problems.
这也是本次课的主题 相关变化率问题

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let’s begin with an example, and that’s exactly the one we talked about earlier on of the falling ladder,
首先举一个例子 这正是我们前面提到的梯子滑落的例子

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
but now we’ve got numbers in it. We have a ladder that’s 5 feet long, and it’s resting initially against a wall, 
但现在我们标明了数据 梯子5英尺长 最初是静止不动地靠着墙壁

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and then it starts to slide down. Let’s say it slides down away from the wall at a rate of 0.5 ft/s
之后开始下滑 举个例子 梯子以0.5英尺/秒的速度滑落下来

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and the bottom of the ladder is 4 feet away from the wall at a certain point.
而梯子底部到墙面的特定位置的距离为4英尺

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The question is how fast is the ladder sliding down at that time instant?
问题是 梯子滑落瞬间的速度是多少？

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The first step in this case is to assign variables to whatever is changing in the problem.
求解这类问题的第一步 是给问题中所有正在改变的量进行变量分配

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There are two things that are changing. There is the height—<i>y</i>, let’s say—and the distance <i>x</i>.
在这个问题中 有两个量正在变化 具体来说是高度<i>y</i>和距离<i>x</i>

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Next I draw a picture of what’s happening. The picture is over here.
接下来 将发生的事情绘制出来 如图所示

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That’s the distance of the base, that’s the height and that’s the actual ladder over here.
这是底部的距离 这是高度 而这是实际的梯子

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay. Now to find a relationship between <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and 5 over here,
好了 现在要找到<i>x</i>、<i>y</i>和5之间的关系

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
you recall the Pythagorean theorem from geometry, and that says that <i>x</i>^2 + <i>y</i>^2 = 5^2.
联想到几何学中的勾股定理 可以得到<i>x</i>^2+<i>y</i>^2=5^2

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That’s the relationship that we require between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. Now because we want to find the rates,
这就是我们想要得到的<i>x</i>和<i>y</i>之间的关系 由于需要寻找变化率

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
we differentiate that relation with respect to <i>t</i>. What you get back is 2<i>x</i>[<i>t</i>]<i>x</i>'[<i>t</i>] + 2<i>y</i>[<i>t</i>]<i>y</i>'[<i>t</i>] = 0.
因此对关系表达式关于<i>t</i>进行微分 得到的是2<i>x</i>[<i>t</i>]<i>x</i>'[<i>t</i>] + 2<i>y</i>[<i>t</i>]<i>y</i>'[<i>t</i>] = 0

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now keep in mind that <i>x</i> is 4 at that point, <i>x</i>' is 0.5, so you get back an equation which is
请注意 <i>x</i>的初始值为4 <i>x</i>'是0.5 因此得到的式子

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
simpler than the earlier one, but it still ignored <i>y</i>’s. Then you recall the Pythagorean theorem,
比前面的会更简单 但仍未知道<i>y</i>的值 联想到勾股定理

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and that lets you find <i>y</i> as being 3. Once we’ve got <i>y</i>, we can plug that back in over here to the earlier equation—
解得<i>y</i>是3 一旦求得<i>y</i> 我们就可以将<i>y</i>代回前面的式子中

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:35,000
that’s this one—and you get back the rate of change of <i>y</i> as being −0.666667.
也就是这个方程 最终得到<i>y</i>的变化率为-0.666667

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 0.67 ft/sec approximately.
也就是说 梯子以大约0.67英尺/秒的速度从墙上滑落

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The question is why is that sign negative? Well, it’s negative because the top of the ladder is actually going down.
为什么滑落速度是负数？负号是由于梯子顶部是向下滑落的

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Having solved that one problem, let’s set up a general strategy for solving such problems.
在解决了这一个问题后 我们来归纳解决这类问题的一般策略

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
First, always try to understand the problem. Make sure you know what you are asked to do.
首先 一定要理解问题 确保你知道问题要求你做什么

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Next, assign symbols to all variables—<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, et cetera—in the problem.
下一步 给问题中的所有变量<i>x</i> <i>y</i>等分配符号

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now to help yourself understand the problem better, draw a picture. It doesn’t have to be very elegant,
接着 为了更好地理解问题 画一张关于问题的图 图不一定要非常美观

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
but it should be just enough for you to understand what you need to do. Next, the creative part:
但应该能让你了解需要做什么 接下来是创意部分

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
find an equation that relates all the variables in the problem.
需要找到一个方程 将问题中的所有变量联系起来

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Usually something from geometry is going to help you to do that. Next differentiate the equation with respect to time using the chain rule.
几何学的知识通常能帮你完成这一步 接下来 使用链式法则 对方程进行关于时间的微分

38
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That’s the key rule for today’s lesson. Now you already know a few variables,
这是本节课的关键法则 现在你已经得到了几个变量

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
but you need to find any remaining unknown variables before you proceed. Once you have done that,
但在进行下一步前 你需要找到剩余的未知变量 一旦完成了这些工作

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
then you substitute all the information that you’ve found out and solve for the true unknown quantity in the problem. 
然后 将找到的所有信息代入 求解出问题中的未知量

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That’s the general strategy for this lesson.
这就是本节课采取的总体策略

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let’s try and apply it to a few more problems. Here you have a spherical balloon
让我们试着把这个策略应用到更多问题上 有一个球形的气球

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
that’s being filled at a rate of 50 cm^3/sec. The question is find the rate at which
在以50 cm^3/秒的速度重启 需要求出

44
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the radius is increasing when the diameter is 25 cm. Now in this case, the volume and the radius are both functions of time.
气球直径为25厘米时的变化率 这种情况下 气球体积和半径都是关于时间的函数

45
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Here’s a picture. It has the radius and the volume as being the variables for the problem.
这是问题的图示 气球的半径和体积都是与问题相关的变量

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Next, you know from geometry that the volume of a sphere is (4/3)π<i>r</i>^3,
接下来 由几何学的知识可知 球的体积是(4/3)π<i>r</i>^3

47
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,000
so that’s the relation. Next you differentiate that relation, and you get back an equation
那么这就是所求的关系 接下来对这个式子进行微分 会得到一个关于<i>v</i>' <i>r</i>和<i>r</i>'的方程

48
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Of course you need to find what <i>r</i> is at that time <i>t</i>, but you know the diameter
当然 你需要得到<i>t</i>时刻对应的<i>r</i> 由于你知道直径为

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
is twice the radius and the diameter is 25, so the radius at that time is 12.5.
是半径的2倍 直径是25 所以当时的半径是12.5

50
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You plug back all the information that’s known to you, and you find that
将所有已知信息都代入 你会发现

51
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:35,000
the radius is increasing at roughly 0.025 cm/sec.
半径在以大约0.025厘米/秒的速度增加

52
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
For the third problem, let’s talk about a watchdog. There is a cat that is walking down a street at 3 feet per second.
第三个问题 是关于看门狗的 有一只猫 它正以每秒3英尺的速度走在大街上

53
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Now, a dog is sitting and sees this cat and stays focused on it.
同时 一条狗正坐在那里 看到并持续关注着这只猫

54
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It doesn’t actually move, but then the dog is known to be 6 feet from the street
其实它并没有动 已知 狗距离街道6英尺

55
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and the cat is 8 feet from that point. The question is how fast is the dog’s head turning?
而猫距离该点有8英尺 问题是狗头的转速是多少？

56
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There are two things that are changing: the dog’s head is turning and the cat is moving away.
有两件事正在发生变化 狗头在转 猫在移动

57
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The question is what do you do over here? Well, you first draw a picture.
问题来了 你需要做什么 嗯 首先 画出示意图

58
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That’s the angle of turning of the dog’s head, that’s the distance traveled by the cat down the street
这是狗头转动的角度 这是猫在街上走过的距离

59
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and this distance over here is given to us to be 6 feet. Now in this case
而这一段的距离是已知的6英尺 在这种情况下

60
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
we have a right-angle triangle, so we can use the tangent of θ as the function <i>x</i>[<i>t</i>]/6.
存在一个直角三角形 因此我们可以使用θ的正切值作为函数 即<i>x</i>[<i>t</i>]/6

61
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Once we have the relation over here, then you can differentiate it and you find that
当我们有了这个关系后 可以对其进行微分 你会发现

62
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
you have another relation for θ' now, but now you need to know what the secant of θ is.
会得到关于θ'的另一个关系 现在你需要知道θ的正割是多少

63
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Well, the point is that you have the Pythagorean theorem, so you use that to work out
利用勾股定理

64
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the hypotenuse of the triangle at that time. It turns out to be 10. Use that to find the secant like we’ve done over here. 
可以得到三角形的斜边长度为10 再如此所示 使用它来求正割值

65
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Once we’ve done that, you can plug in all the values
完成了这些 你可以代入所有的已知值

66
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and work out the rate at which the dog’s head is turning.
并计算出狗头转动的速度

67
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The dog’s head is rotating at 9/50 radians/sec or about 10.313 degrees/sec.
狗头以9/50弧度/秒的速度旋转 即约10.313度/秒。

68
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay. On to the final problem for the lesson. Oil is being poured into an inverted cone at a rate of 3 m^3/sec. 
好 现在进入本课的最后一道题 油正以3米^3/秒的速度被倒入一个倒置的圆锥体中

69
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That’s the rate of change of the volume. Given that the cone’s height is 10 m
这就是体积的变化率 给定圆锥体的高度是10米

70
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and the radius is 5 m, the question is find the rate at which the oil level is rising
半径为5米 问题是求油的液位上升的速度

71
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:14,000
when the oil is 5 m deep. You’ve got two variables over here: the volume and the height.
油深5米时存在两个变量 体积和高度

72
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That’s the picture for the problem. Now, you know from geometry that the volume of a cone
这是问题的图示 基于几何学的知识 一个圆锥的体积

73
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
is given by (1/3)π<i>r</i>^2<i>h</i>, so that’s the equation for the problem.
由(1/3)π< i>r</i>^2< i>h</i>给出 这也是问题的方程

74
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Notice that you in fact have <i>v</i>, <i>h</i> and <i>r</i>, and in fact you want to work only with <i>v</i> and <i>h</i>,
请注意 存在<i>v</i>、<i>h</i>和<i>r</i>三个变量 但实际上只需要用到<i>v</i>和<i>h</i>

75
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
so we need to do a bit more work. Recall that when you studied similar triangles,
因此我们需要再进行一些处理 回顾相似三角形知识

76
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
then you could find a relationship between the base and height. In this case,
可以得到底面与高度之间的关系 在该问题中

77
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
the radius is going to be half the height in the oil tank because by similarity,
根据相似性 半径长度是油箱液位高度的一半

78
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
any cone in the tank has a radius equal to half the height because you have the initial ones and the same ratio.
油罐内任何锥体的半径是液位高度一半 是因为最初的椎体具有相同的比例

79
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Here’s the volume equation with that relationship.
这是代入以上关系后得到的体积公式

80
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You differentiate it and plug in values, and you find that oil level is rising at 12/25π m/s.
对其进行微分 代入数据 得到油罐液位正以12/25π米/秒的速度上升

81
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of the lesson, but our main objective over here
好的 本节课接近尾声了 本节课我们的主要目标

82
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
was to solve problems which involved related rates. What we did was we set up
是解决涉及相关变化率的问题 我们首先确立了解决

83
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
a general strategy for these problems. Then we solved a few of them, but in each case,
这类问题的一般策略 然后 我们解决了几个该类别的问题 在每一个问题中

84
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
what you need to do is to use the given information and then apply some geometry
你需要做的是利用给定的信息 结合一些几何知识

85
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:06,000
typically to get the equations required for the problem. That’s the end of this topic.
主要是为了得到求解问题所需的方程 本次课的内容到此结束

86
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
In the next lesson, we’ll talk about linear approximations, but before we do that,
下一节课 我们会讨论线性近似 在此之前

87
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
do review this lesson. This was a pretty advanced application of calculus.
请复习这节课 这是一堂内容相当高级的微积分应用课

88
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It’s just that we now know calculus so well that we can apply things quite easily,
现在 我们对微积分了解透彻 应用这些知识比较熟练

89
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
but do review this lesson, look at the exercises and you should be ready for the next one on linear approximations. 
但也请复习一下这节课 看看练习 为下一节课做好准备

90
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you.
本次课到此结束 谢谢大家！
