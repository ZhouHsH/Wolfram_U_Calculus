Hello, and welcome to Lesson 15 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好 欢迎来到Wolfram U的微积分入门课程第15课

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic for this lesson is linear approximations.
本课的主题是线性近似

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of this lesson. You may recall that the derivative of a function
首先 简单介绍一下本课内容 你可能还记得函数的导数

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is calculated by zooming in on it with some limits. Typically you take some limit as,
是通过逼近某些极限值来计算的 通常情况下 极限值取为

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
let’s say, <i>h</i>→0 or some other variable, and the point is that as you get closer and closer
比方说 <i>h</i>→0或其他变量 当越来越逼近

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to a desired point, then the function begins to look like its tangent line.
所需的点 函数曲线看起来就像该点切线

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
For example, here’s a function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^2, and that’s the function, that’s the tangent line.
例如 函数<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]=<i>x</i>^2 如图所示 这是函数图线 这是该点切线图像

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We can see that very close to the point (1, 1), they both look essentially identical.
可以发现 二者在非常接近（1，1）的位置附近 看起来基本相同

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You can use this property to approximate a function near a point with its tangent line,
借助这个特性 可以使用切线估计切点附近的函数

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and that’s a dramatic simplification. After all, a curve is a rather complicated object,
这是对原函数极大的简化 毕竟 曲线相当复杂

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and a straight line is perhaps the simplest of geometrical objects. If you can replace a function
而直线可能是最简单的几何对象 如果你能将一个函数

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
with its tangent line, that’s great, and that’s the topic of this lesson. Namely, we’d like to
用它的切线来进行替换 这样子将非常好 这也是本节课的主题 也就是说 我们要

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
talk about linear approximations, but we’ll also talk about so-called differentials
讨论线性近似 同时我们也会讨论微分

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and some of their applications.
以及它们的一些应用

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let’s begin with the topic of linear approximation. You may recall that the tangent line at any point, <i>x</i> = <i>a</i>, 
首先是线性近似的话题 大家可能还记得 任意一点<i>x</i> = <i>a</i>处的切线

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
is given by an equation of that type. Now, the <i>y</i> over here is a point on the tangent line,
可以由这种形式的方程给出 式中的<i>y</i>是切线上的点

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but what you could do is to replace <i>y</i> by <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], the function itself, and then you get
可以用函数本身<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]代替<i>y</i> 就可以得到

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
an approximate quality whereby the value of <i>f</i> at <i>x</i> can be approximated by using its derivative at the point <i>a</i>.
一个近似值 即<i>f</i>在<i>x</i>处的值可以用点<i>a</i>处的导数进行近似

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This approximation is called the linear approximation of <i>f</i> at <i>a</i>
这种近似被称为<i>f</i>在<i>a</i>处的线性近似

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,000
because the tangent line is being used to approximate <i>f</i>. Here’s a picture. You have the function
称为线性近似原因是切线被用来近似<i>f</i> 如图所示 函数

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and you have tangent line, and the tangent line is now called the linearization.
及其切线 图中的切线也被称为线性化

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Linear approximations are a very important tool in calculus, and as an example,
线性近似是微积分中非常重要的工具 举例说明

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
let’s take this function, <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = Sqrt[<i>x</i> + 8]. What we want to do is to approximate values of
选取函数 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]=Sqrt[<i>x</i>+8] 我们需要借助这个函数近似地求出

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the square root at 8.98 and 9.03 within this function. Obviously when <i>x</i> is 1,
8.98和9.03的平方根 显然 当<i>x</i>为1时

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:02,000
the square root of 9 is just 3, so what we do is we work near 1, and we get back <i>f</i>'[1] is 1/6.
9的平方根是3 所以我们选择在1附近进行近似运算 得到<i>f</i>'[1]为1/6

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now you set up the equation of the tangent line. Tangent is equal to 3 + (1/6)(<i>x</i> − 1),
列出切线的方程 切线方程为3+（1/6）（<i>x</i>-1）

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and you get back the tangent expression. Now when <i>x</i> is 0.98, you are at 8.98.
就可以得到切线的表达式 则当<i>x</i>为0.98时 对应估计8.98的平方根

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The next one is 1.03—then you are at 9.03. You can use the tangent line to approximate
另一个则是1.03 对应估计9.03的平方根 利用切线估计

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the values over there, and those are the square roots at those two points approximately.
这两个值 得到这两个近似的平方根值

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Here’s the picture, and in the picture, you see you have the function, the linear approximation
结果如图所示 图中有函数图像、线性近似的直线

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and the values at the nearby points. You can see that the approximations are very, very close to the original function,
以及估计点附近的值 可以发现 近似函数与原函数非常接近

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
though of course they are not exactly the same.
尽管它们并不完全相同

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay. The question now is how accurate is that approximation? Suppose you want to have
好 接下来的问题是 近似的准确性如何？假设你要求

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
an accuracy of within 0.5 units. Well, here’s the equation. That’s the exact expression
估计的误差在0.5以内 列出不等式 这部分是准确的表达式

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and that’s the tangent. You want that difference to be less than 0.5. What you can do is
而这部分是近似函数 为使这个差值小于0.5 你可以

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
set up an equation with the reduced function and solve. Numerically, the values
列出不等式 化简 并求解 不等式的解集数值上

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
lie between −6.3 and 14.39. As long as you stay within that range of <i>x</i>, you’ll get an approximation
介于-6.3和14.39之间 只要<i>x</i>在这个范围内 你都能得到近似值

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,000
which is correct within 0.5 units. Now, let’s say you want to increase the accuracy to be less than 0.1.
且误差在0.5之内 现在 假设将精度要求提高到误差小于0.1

39
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Then you set up the equation with 1/10 over here, and you get back the values. In this case,
不等式右边变为1/10 求解 在这种情况下

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
we have a much tighter range from −3.04 to 6.2, roughly.
范围缩小了许多 大约介于-3.04和6.2之间

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay. In physics, one needs this notion of linear approximation all the time.
好 在物理学中 经常需要用到线性近似的概念

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
For example, when one studies the pendulum and you want to talk about
例如 研究摆的时候 需要讨论

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
the period of the pendulum, you start with the equation for the acceleration.
摆的周期 首先从加速度方程入手

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That’s the tangential acceleration <i>at</i> and <i>g</i> is the acceleration for gravity.
这是切向加速度<i>at</i>的表达式 式中<i>g</i>是重力加速度

45
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
θ is the angle that the pendulum makes with the vertical. The point is that
θ是钟摆与垂直面所成的角度 关键点在于

46
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
when your rate goes to 0, then sine has got a slope of 1 because cosine of 0 is 1,
速率为0时 正弦函数的导数值为1 原因是0的余弦为1

47
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and the value of sine at (0, 0)—so near 0 when θ is very small, Sin[θ] is approximately equal to θ.
并且 当θ非常小且在0附近时 Sin[θ]近似等于θ

48
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If you replace the Sin[θ] over there with the θ, then you get back a much simpler equation,
如果你将式中的Sin[θ]换成θ 会得到一个更简单的公式

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and that’s the one that’s used in physics textbooks at the elementary level. As you go more advanced,
这也是初级水平的物理教科书中使用的公式 随着研究更加深入

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
of course you might want a better approximation. Here’s a picture of the actual acceleration, the current one,
你肯定会想要更好的近似值 以下是该情况下实际加速度

51
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and the linear approximation. Of course, you see that they are both
和线性近似得到的加速度曲线的对比 可以发现 两者

52
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
very close by as long as you do not go very far away from 0.
在距离0不远处非常接近

53
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay. A related notion is the notion of a differential. To understand that, remember that
好 另一个相关概念是微分 为了理解微分 请记住

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the derivative is sometimes denoted as <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>. Now <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i> is the same as <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>],
导数有时可以表示为<i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i> 即<i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>与<i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>]是相同的

55
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
so if you kind of cross-multiply, then you get the equation <i>dy</i> = <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>.
因此 对式子两边同时相乘 会得到公式<i>dy</i>=<i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>。

56
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
These quantities <i>dx</i> and <i>dy</i> are called differentials, so they represent the change in <i>x</i>
<i>dx</i>和<i>dy</i>被称为微分 它们分别表示<i>x</i>的变化情况

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and the change in <i>y</i> respectively. Of course if you’re given <i>dx</i> over here, then you can
和<i>y</i>的变化情况 显然 如果给定<i>dx</i> 那么你可以用

58
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
work out <i>dy</i> using <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>]. That’s like a small machine where as you put in different <i>dx</i>s over here,
<i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>]计算出<i>dy</i> 这就像一台小机器 输入不同的<i>dx</i>

59
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you get different <i>dy</i>s over there. Here’s a picture. The picture is that
会得到不同的<i>dy</i> 如图所示 图中展示的是

60
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
as you stay close to <i>x</i> over here, then you can use the approximation to find the change in <i>y</i>.
逼近<i>x</i> 那么可以用近似值来计算<i>y</i>的变化

61
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But of course that’s still approximate, so the question is how does that relate to the actual differences?
这依旧是近似值 那么这个近似值和实际的变化之间存在什么关系呢？

62
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Here’s an example where you have a function, and the problem is to work out <i>df</i>,
举例说明 给定一个函数 需要计算出<i>df</i>

63
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:37,000
the approximate change, and the actual change when <i>x</i> goes from 3 to 3.05. Let’s first work out
的近似变化 以及<i>x</i>从3变为3.05时的函数值实际变化 首先

64
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the exact change using subtraction. Now here is the approximate change given by <i>df</i>,
用减法求出实际的变化 而这个式子是由<i>df</i>给出的近似变化

65
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and you can see they are pretty close to each other. In general, that’s
可以发现它们相当接近 一般来说 这就是

66
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
the equation for the change in <i>f</i> when you make a small change in <i>x</i>. Here’s a picture of the function
对<i>x</i>做微小改变时 计算<i>f</i>变化量的公式 以下是函数图像

67
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and its approximation, and you can see, again, that as long as you stay close to 3,
及其近似的对比 可以发现类似的结果 只要保持在3附近

68
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
the approximation is quite good.
近似效果就相当不错

69
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay. The question is why are differentials important? The reason why they’re important is that
你可能会问为什么微分很重要？微分重要的原因在于

70
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
sometimes you may not be able to find Δ<i>f</i> that actually is <i>f</i> exactly, and then you might as well
有时你可能无法准确求出<i>f</i>中的Δ<i>f</i> 这种情况下你可能

71
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
use the differential because they are really quite helpful and easy to work with.
会使用微分 因为微分非常有用而且方便

72
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
In fact, what we’re talking about over here is exactly the same as linear approximations.
实际上 我们这里讨论的与线性近似完全一样

73
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Here’s the equation for a linear approximation in the differential language:
以下是使用微分的线性近似方程

74
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:53,000
<i>f</i>[<i>x</i> + <i>dx</i>] is the value of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] + <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>. As an example, here is the function Sqrt[<i>x</i> + 8] again.
<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>+<i>dx</i>]等于<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]+<i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>的值 再次使用函数Sqrt[<i>x</i>+8]作为例子

75
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That’s the differential. You plug in the value of −0.02 for <i>dx</i>, and then you see that it’s pretty close
这是函数的微分 代入<i>dx</i>等于-0.02 会发现微分的值

76
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
to the value of the function at 0.98. The point is that differentials are
与函数在0.98处的函数值非常接近 实际上 微分是

77
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
just another way of talking about linear approximations.
线性近似的另一种表示形式

78
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay. One important place where they are useful is when you want to estimate errors.
好 线性估计的重要且有效的应用之一是估计误差

79
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
For example, suppose that the radius of the sphere is 11 cm and you know that
例如 假设小球半径为11厘米 并且已知

80
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the error in measurement is about 0.1 cm. What you want to do is to find out
测量误差约为0.1厘米 需要求出

81
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
the maximum error when you calculate the volume of the sphere.
计算球体体积时的最大误差

82
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Now the volume of a sphere is 4/3π<i>r</i>^3, so you differentiate that equation. Now volume prime
球体的体积公式为4/3π<i>r</i>^3 对这个方程进行微分 现在体积的导数

83
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:08,000
is the same as <i>dvol</i>/<i>dr</i>, so you can rewrite the equation as <i>dvol</i> = 4π^2<i>dr</i>,
为<i>dvol</i>/<i>dr</i> 将方程改写为<i>dvol</i>=4π^2<i>dr</i>。

84
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and then because <i>r</i> is 11 and <i>dr</i> is 0.1—that’s the error—you can work out the error in the volume.
又因为<i>r</i>为11 <i>dr</i>即误差 为0.1 就可以计算出体积的误差

85
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It turns out to be 152, approximately. Now that looks like a huge number.
结果大约是152 看上去是一个巨大的数字

86
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The question is why is it so large? Well, the point is that you really need to talk about
为什么误差这么大？其实 为理解误差有多大 真正需要讨论的是

87
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
the relative error over here to understand what’s happening. The relative error is the error
相对误差 相对误差是误差值

88
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
divided by the actual volume, and then that is just 0.027, so of course things look
除以实际的体积 结果为0.027 这看起来

89
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
much better than they did before. If you do not plug in the value of <i>r</i> over here,
比原来好很多 如果你不将<i>r</i>的值代入

90
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:07,000
then the relative error looks like 3<i>dr</i>/<i>r</i>, but that’s just 3 times the relative error and the radius.
那么 相对误差为3<i>dr</i>/<i>r</i> 式中只包含3倍的相对误差和半径两个量

91
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That says that the error in the volume is three times the error in the radius,
这说明体积的误差是半径误差的三倍

92
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
provided that you talk about relative elements. Now the other way to talk about these errors
这在讨论相对误差时才成立 另一种讨论误差的方式

93
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
is to use a percentage error.
是使用百分比误差

94
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The percentage error in this case is 2.7 for the volume and 0.9 for the radius.
本例中 体积的百分比误差为2.7% 而半径为0.9%

95
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay. That brings us to the end of this lesson, and the main point is that
好 本次课接近尾声了 本节课的主要内容包括

96
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
linear approximations are very important in mathematics and science. All we do
线性近似在数学和科学领域中是非常重要的 线性近似中所做的

97
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
in such a case is replace a function by its tangent line. As long as you stay close to the point,
是用其切线代替原函数 当距离切点足够近时

98
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
then the approximation is very close to the actual function. One place where you might find them
近似值就非常接近实际函数值 线性近似的一个重要应用领域

99
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
really useful is in physics, but of course they are also useful in chemistry
是物理学 但它们也在化学

100
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and in economics and in finance. Wherever you go, you will find the need to use linear approximations.
经济学和金融学中发挥作用 无论是哪个领域 都有需要使用线性近似的场合

101
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Another way of talking about these approximations is to use differentials,
微分是近似的另一种表述方式

102
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and those are particularly useful when you want to talk about errors in measurements.
在讨论测量误差时 微分特别有用

103
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That brings me to the end of this lesson. In the next lesson we’ll talk about maxima and minima,
这节课就到此结束了 下一节课我们要讲的是最大值和最小值

104
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
but before doing that, we will have a problem session to go over some examples for errors and approximations, 
在此之前 会有一个问题环节 包含误差与近似相关的例子

105
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and then we’ll get back to maxima and minima.
然后我们再来讨论最大值和最小值

106
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I hope you’ve found this lesson useful. It’s a very important lesson.
我希望这节课对你有用 这是一节非常重要的课

107
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Do review it and be ready for the next session. Thank you.
请务必做好复习 并为下节课做好准备 谢谢！
