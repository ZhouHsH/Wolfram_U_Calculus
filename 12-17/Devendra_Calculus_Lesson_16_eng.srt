00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 16 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好 欢迎来到Wolfram U的微积分入门课程第16课

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic for this lesson is maxima and minima.
本节课的主题是最大值和最小值

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson. Many mathematical problems involve
首先 简单介绍一下本课的内容 很多数学问题都涉及到

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
getting the best solution for a task. In fact, people use mathematics when they really do want the best solution for a task. 
求解任务的最佳解决方案 事实上 当真正需要求解任务的最佳解决方案时 人们往往会使用数学

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There’s a word for best solution. It’s usually called optimal solution,
最佳解决方案通常被称为最优解

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and the whole process of getting such a solution is called optimization.
而得到最优解的过程叫优化

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay. As an example of optimization, let’s take this function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] and plot it.
举一个优化的例子 给定函数<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 并绘制其图像

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The plot is a downward-opening parabola, and the highest value of this plot is clearly at (0, 3).
函数图像是向下开口的抛物线 显然 函数的最大值点为（0，3）

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In this case, our notion of best or optimal is the highest value. Typically, one wants to talk about
在这个例子中 最佳或最优的定义就是最大值 通常情况下 人们

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
maxima and minima in various problems. The goal of this lesson is to develop a process
在各种问题中都会讨论最大值和最小值 本节课的目标 是确定一个流程

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
for finding maxima or minima for different problems using derivatives.
用来借助导数寻找不同问题的最大值或最小值

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Various people use optimization in different ways. For example, if you run a business,
不同的人使用不同的方式进行优化 例如 假设你经营一家企业

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
then clearly what you want to do is to maximize your profit and minimize your cost.
显然 你想要的是利润最大化、成本最小化

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Even a plant knows that it must grow in such a way that it obtains the maximum amount of sunlight.
即便是植物 它们也知道需要获得最多的阳光以生存

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A GPS system is designed to get you to a destination in either the shortest amount of time or distance.
GPS系统被设计为 让你在最短的时间或距离内到达目的地

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
In general, you have optimization problems which involve either finding the maximum or the minimum.
一般来说 优化问题涉及到寻找最大值或最小值

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Differential calculus is really an excellent tool for solving these optimization problems.
微分学是解决优化问题的绝佳工具

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
In fact, that’s how the subject arose in the works of Fermat and other mathematicians.
事实上 在费马和其他数学家的作品中 优化课题就是这样产生的

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let’s now go ahead and talk about the notion of an absolute maximum or minimum.
首先讨论最大值和最小值的概念

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
A value <i>f</i>[<i>c</i>] is an absolute maximum of a function if its value is greater than or equal to
<i>f</i>[<i>c</i>]为函数最大值的条件是 该函数值大于或等于

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
every other value for the values in a certain set D where D is called the domain.
函数在某个集合D中的任意其他值（除<i>c</i>以外） 其中D称为函数定义域

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
When I say maximum and I say absolute maximum, I mean the very greatest value of a function.
当提及最大或绝对最大时 指的就是函数的最大值

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Similarly, if one says absolute minimum, you mean the least value of a function on a certain set D.
类似地 如果是绝对最小 指的是函数在某一集合D上的最小值

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,000
For example, if we take the sine function, clearly its maximum is over here at π/2
举例说明 正弦函数 显然 它的最大值在π/2处

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
where it’s got a value of 1, and its minimum is at 3π/2 where it’s got the value −1.
函数值为1 而最小值在3π/2处 函数值为-1

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Another term used for absolute maximum and minimum is global maximum and minimum.
绝对最大值和最小值又称为全局最大值和最小值

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
When you say absolute, it means the same thing as global.
绝对与全局的意思一样

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay. Together, these maxima and minima are sometimes called the extreme values of the function.
最大值和最小值 有时也被称为函数的极值

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In this case, we’re lucky. We had an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum.
在这个例子中 很幸运 函数有一个绝对最大值和一个绝对最小值

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But in general, the best that you can hope for are so-called local maxima and minima.
总体而言 局部最大值和最小值是你应该期望的

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
For example, here is a function, a cubic function, and you can see quite clearly that
例如 这是一个三次函数 明显可以看到

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
this graph has got local maxima and minima. That’s the local maximum over here,
函数有局部最大值和最小值 局部最大值在这里

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and that’s the local minimum over there, but if you go far away enough, the values will
这里是局部最小值 如果移动足够远 函数值将

34
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:25,000
go up or go down dramatically. The idea of a local maximum is that you have a value <i>f</i>[<i>c</i>]
剧烈增加或下降 局部最大值的概念是 一个函数值<i>f</i>[<i>c</i>]

35
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
which is more than other values for <i>x</i> near <i>c</i>, and similarly for local minima.
对于<i>c</i>附近的<i>x</i> 都有<i>f</i>[<i>c</i>]大于<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 类似的可以得到局部最小值的定义

36
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Near depends upon the function of course, but that’s a nice way about talking about maxima and minima—
定义中的附近取决于函数 但这是一种讨论最大值和最小值很好的方式

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
by using the local definition rather than the global definition. In the case over here,
即使用局部最值的定义而不是全局最值的定义 上述例子中

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
there is a local maximum at that point and a local minimum at that point.
这是一个局部最大值点 这是一个局部最小值点

39
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We’ll see that quite shortly. Of course, if you have an absolute maximum,
我们很快就能得到这一点 当然 如果是一个绝对最大值

40
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
that’s clearly a local maximum, and if you have an absolute minimum, that’s clearly a local minimum.
那显然也是一个局部最大值 如果是一个绝对最小值 那显然也是一个局部最小值

41
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The fact that you have absolute maxima and minima is very special knowledge—
事实上 有绝对最大值和最小值点意味着包含特别的性质

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
much better than having local maxima or minima.
相比于局部最大值或最小值而言

43
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay. Things could go wrong or be different in some cases. For example, if you have
在某些情况下 情况可能不同甚至出错 例如

44
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the constant function like over here, the constant function 5, then clearly every real number is
像这样的常数函数5 那么显然每个实数5都是

45
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
an absolute maximum and minimum. On the other hand, if you have the cubic function over here,
绝对最大值和最小值 另一个例子 这里的三次函数

46
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
then you have neither an absolute or local maximum or minimum everywhere.
在任何地方都没有绝对或局部最大最小值点

47
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
These are very special cases which are worth remembering as we talk about maxima and minima.
这些都是在讨论最大值和最小值时需要记住的特殊情况

48
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Namely, you could have situations in which you have everything being optimal or nothing being optimal.
也就是说 可能会出现任意点都是最优解 或没有点是最优解

49
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay. Now the question is how do we find these extreme values, but even if we’re talking about that,
那么 现在的问题是 如何才能找到这些极值 尽管我们已经正在讨论这个问题

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
we need to figure out some conditions under which one can guarantee that they’re extreme values.
我们仍然需要找出一些极值点的条件 在这些条件下 可以保证它们是极值

51
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is what’s called the extreme value theorem. What that does is it gives you conditions
这就是极值定理 其作用是 提供了判断

52
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
for when a function is guaranteed to have extreme values. It says that if you have a function
一个函数存在极值点的条件 极值定理如下 一个 

53
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
on a closed interval and that function is continuous—so you have a continuous function
闭区间上的连续函数

54
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
on a closed interval [<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>]—then that function will attain an absolute maximum
该函数必然存在一个绝对最大值

55
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and an absolute minimum at some numbers <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> on the interval. As long as you have
和绝对最小值 分别在区间上的<i>c</i>和<i>d</i>处取得 只要你有

56
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
a continuous function and a closed interval, you are fine. For example, I have these three plots over here,
一个连续函数和一个闭区间 条件就可以成立 举例 这里有三张图

57
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and the black dots will indicate that that side of the interval is closed, and the white dots
黑色点代表区间的这一侧是封闭的 而白色点

58
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
or the blank dots will indicate that you have an interval side which is not closed.
或者空白点意味着区间这一侧不封闭

59
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
In the first example, you see you’ve got two black dots, so that’s a closed interval,
第一个例子中 有两个黑色点 所以是一个闭区间

60
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and clearly you have a continuous function. There are no breaks in the graph.
显然 这是一个连续函数 图中没有间断点

61
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You have an absolute minimum over here and an absolute maximum over there.
因此 这里是绝对最小值 那里是绝对最大值

62
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That’s the first example. It attains an absolute maximum and minimum on the interval.
这是第一个例子 其在区间上存在一个绝对最大值和最小值点

63
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
On the other hand, the second example is not in the scope of the discussion today
另一方面 第二个例子不在今天的讨论范围内

64
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
because you have over here a function which is not continuous. You can see over here that
因为这是一个不连续的函数 在图中的这个位置

65
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
there’s a sort of break in the graph. The theorem does not apply and you do not need to worry about
存在间断 该定理不适用 你无需担心

66
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
whether there are absolute maxima or minima, but of course in this case,
该函数是否存在绝对最大值或最小值 当然在这种情况下

67
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
you actually do not have them because the function seems to go off to minus infinity over here
实际并不存在绝对最大值或最小值 因为函数在这边趋向负无穷

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and plus infinity over there. The last example is again not quite relevant
而在那边趋向正无穷 最后一个例子也不太相关

69
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
because here you have an open interval. Because the interval is not closed, or is open,
因为函数定义在开区间上 即区间不是封闭的 而是开放的

70
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
therefore you cannot guarantee anything from the extreme value theorem. But in fact in this case,
因此你不能由极值定理上得到什么结论 事实上在这个例子中

71
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
there is neither an absolute maximum or minimum precisely because of the issue of missing endpoints.
正因为区间缺少端点 所以函数既没有绝对最大值 也没有最小值

72
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay. The question now is how do we actually find these extreme values.
接下来的问题是如何求出极值

73
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The best tool we have for this is Fermat’s theorem given by Pierre de Fermat a long time ago.
解决这个问题的最好工具是皮埃尔·德·费马多年前给出的费马定理

74
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What that does is it lets us find local maxima and minima. What it says is if <i>f</i> has
费马定理能让我们求得局部最大值和最小值 其内容是如果<i>f</i>存在

75
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
a local maximum or minimum, then its derivative at that point must be 0. For example,
局部最大值或最小值 那么函数在该点的导数必为0 例如

76
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
if you look at the earlier function, then the claim is that it’s got local maxima and minima over here and there,
回顾前面的这个函数 它在该点和那点存在局部最大值和最小值

77
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and you can check that with the derivatives at those points. They are both 0,
你可以检查这些点的导数 都是0

78
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
so Fermat’s theorem will say that that’s the condition to be satisfied for local maxima and minima.
根据费马定理 这就是局部最大值和最小值需要满足的条件

79
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay. There are a few things to remember about Fermat’s theorem. The converse is not true,
关于费马定理有几个需要注意的点 费马定理的逆命题并不成立

80
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and it’s not true in a few ways. For example, we have a function over here, a cubed function,
不成立的原因有几方面 例如 这是一个三次函数

81
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and clearly you have a horizontal tangent over here. The derivative is 0,
显然 函数具有在该点处具有水平切线 导数是0

82
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and yet there are no maxima or minima. The theorem mainly says that if you have
却没有最大值和最小值 费马定理说的是如果存在

83
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
a maximum or minimum, then the derivative must be 0. The other example is
最大值或最小值 那么导数一定是0 另一个例子是

84
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
the absolute value function where you do have a minimum, but then the derivative does not exist at that point. 
绝对值函数 函数的确存在一个最小值 但是该点导数不存在。

85
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Fermat’s theorem must be used with caution, but it is in fact a very powerful theorem.
费马定理一定要谨慎使用 不过它也确实是一个非常强大的定理

86
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Fermat’s theorem is really talking about what are called critical numbers.
费马定理其实讨论的是驻点

87
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
When you want to look for maxima and minima, you need to look for what are called critical numbers.
当你要求最大值和最小值时 你需要求出驻点

88
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What’s a critical number? Well, a critical number is a number where either you have a 0 derivative
什么是驻点？驻点是令导数为0

89
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,000
or the derivative does not exist. For example, the cube root function has a critical point
或导数不存在的数 例如 立方根函数的驻点

90
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
over here because the derivative is not defined there.
在这里 因为该点导数无定义

91
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Of course, the local maxima and minima are good places to look for critical points.
局部最大值和最小值点也是寻找驻点的位置

92
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,000
With all that information, we are now ready to put together a method for finding absolute maxima and minima.
综上所述 将求绝对最大值和最小值的方法总结归纳

93
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That’s what is called the closed interval method. What it says is to find the absolute maximum
方法是所谓的闭区间法 为找到闭区间上连续函数的绝对最大值

94
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and minimum of a continuous function on a closed interval, you first of all find out
和最小值 你首先要求出所有

95
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
the critical numbers, find out the values of the function at those critical numbers,
驻点 并求出驻点处的函数值

96
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:16,000
then you work out the value at the endpoints and then the largest of all those values
再计算出区间端点的函数值 取以上这些值中最大的一个

97
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
is the absolute maximum and the smallest value will be the absolute minimum.
作为绝对最大值 最小值则为绝对最小值

98
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
As an example, here’s a cubic function. We find the derivative, set it equal to 0 and figure out
举例说明 这是一个三次函数 先求导数 令其为0 然后计算出

99
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:44,000
that 1 is a critical point. Add that 1 to the list 0 and 2. You’ve got to look at 0, 1 and 2.
那1是一个驻点 将1添加到0和2的求解列表中 需要关注的是0 1和2

100
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
0 and 2 are the endpoints of the interval, 1 is a critical point, and you find that
因为0和2是区间端点 1是临界点 可以求得

101
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
the minimum value occurs at −1 and the maximum value occurs at 2.
最小值为-1 最大值为2

102
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You have an absolute maximum at (2, 2) and you have an absolute minimum at (−1, 1).
则绝对最大值在（2，2）取得 绝对最小值在（-1，1）取得

103
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We have two very nice functions called Maximize and Minimize which will do that automatically for you, and there you are. 
Wolfram语言包含有两个很有用的函数 Maximize和Minimize 可以自动求得最大最小值 如下所示

104
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It says that the maximum is at (2, 2)
结果显示 最大值点为（2，2）

105
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and the minimum is at (−1, 1), just as we learned earlier on. But the closed interval method
而最小值点在（-1，1） 与前面求得的结果一致 闭区间法

106
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
is the basic tool for finding maxima and minima on a closed interval.
是在闭区间上寻找最大值和最小值的基本工具

107
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
As an application, let’s take this example. We have the cost function for a business,
作为应用 这个例子包含一个企业的成本函数

108
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and the question is to find the number of units <i>x</i> that minimize the cost. What you do is
需要求得使成本最小的商品数量<i>x</i> 你需要做的是

109
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
you find the critical points. There’s just one over here. It’s about 6,790.
求出驻点 驻点只有一个大约为6790

110
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You plug in the critical point and the endpoints over here. Then what you do is you work out
再将驻点和端点代入 计算出

111
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the values at those points, and you find out that you need to produce around 6,790 units
在这些点处的成本 可以得出 需要生产大约6790件商品

112
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
to minimize the cost. Here’s a plot for the problem, and you can see quite clearly that
使成本最小化 以下成本函数的图像 可以清晰地看到

113
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
you actually do have a minimum somewhere around 7,000. That’s the end of this lesson.
函数存在一个最小值点在7000附近 至此 本次课接近尾声了

114
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let’s summarize. We certainly realize that optimization is a crucial component of our lives from day to day. 
我们来总结一下 我们意识到 优化是我们日常生活中至关重要的组成部分

115
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Different people will use it in different ways. For example, businesses will want
不同的人会在不同场合使用优化 例如 企业希望

116
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
to make the most money with the least amount of cost, while drivers might want to reduce
以最小的成本赚取最大的利润 而司机们想节省

117
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
the time that they take to go from one place to another. The basic tool in this area is Fermat’s theorem,
从一个地方到另一个地方所花费的时间 优化问题的基本工具是费马定理

118
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:00,000
which lets us find the critical numbers for a function. The closed interval method is
费马定理让我们求得函数的驻点 而闭区间法是

119
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
a complete method for finding the absolute maxima and minima. That’s the end of this lesson.
求绝对最大值和最小值的完整方法 本次课到此结束了

120
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The next lesson will talk about the mean value theorem, a very important theorem in calculus.
下节课将要讲均值定理 这是微积分中非常重要的定理

121
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But before we do that, please do review today’s lesson, look at the exercises and make sure that
在这之前 请大家先务必复习一下今天的课程 看看习题 确定

122
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
you’re ready for the next lesson on the mean value theorem. Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
准备好上下一节关于均值定理的课 非常感谢！本次课就到这里
