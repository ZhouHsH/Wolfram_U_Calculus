00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 23 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好 欢迎来到本次与沃尔夫兰大学合作的微积分入门第23课

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The topic for this lesson is Riemann sums.
本节课的课题是黎曼和

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.
我们先来简单介绍一下本课的内容

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Basically there are two fundamental aspects of calculus.
基本上微积分有两个基本方面

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first aspect is differential calculus,
第一个方面是微分计算

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and that’s what we’ve been talking about all the time so far.
这也是到目前为止我们一直在谈论的

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now the prime motivation over there is to find the slope of a curve at a point of the tangent line.
现在那边的首要动机是求出曲线在切线某点的斜率

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now the second aspect of calculus is the so-called integral calculus,
现在微积分的第二个方面就是所谓的积分微积分

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and that is what we’ll cover from now on.
这也是我们从现在开始要做的事情

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now the basic motivation, the prime motivation for this part of calculus is quite simple.
现在基本的动机 这部分微积分的首要动机很简单

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Basically here is a plot of this function, and the problem is that
基本上这里是这个函数的图 问题是

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
you’d like to find this area under the curve for the function.
你想找到这个函数的曲线下面积

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In this lesson, what we’ll do is we’ll devise a precise way
在本课中我们要做的是 我们将设计一个精确的方式

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
of expressing this notion of area under the curve mathematically.
曲线下的面积这一概念在数学上的表达

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay. Let’s begin with some review of your earlier work.
好吧 我们先来回顾一下您之前的工作

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
If you have a rectangle, then its area is length times width.
如果你有一个矩形 那么它的面积就是长度乘以宽度

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
On the other hand, if it were a triangle, then its area is base times height over 2.
另一方面 如果它是一个三角形 那么它的面积就是底乘以高度除以 2

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But if you have a general polygon, what you’d do is you’d break it up into triangles,
但如果你有一个一般的多边形 你要做的是把它分解成三角形

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
then find the area of each one triangle and then add them all together.
然后找出每一个三角形的面积 再把它们加在一起

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now the area of a circle is a bit harder because it involves the number π,
现在圆的面积有点难 因为它涉及到数字 π

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
but that’s straightforward to work with.
但这是直接的工作

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The question now is what happens if you have a more general curve?
现在的问题是 如果你有一条更随机的曲线会怎样

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let’s say you have this parabola, and you want to find the area under the parabola.
假设你有一条抛物线 你想找到抛物线下的面积

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How do you work it out?
你怎么解决

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
To motivate our discussion, let’s recall the idea of the slope at a point.
为了激发我们的讨论 让我们回顾一下某点的斜率的概念

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let’s say if you have a differentiable function, then the slopes of
比方说 如果你有一个可微分函数 那么斜率为

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the secant lines at a point will eventually approach some value <i>m</i>,
在某一点上的割线最终会接近某个值 <i>m</i>

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
which is the slope of the tangent at that point.
即该点的切线的斜率

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Here’s an example to illustrate that.
这里有一个例子

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You have a curve <i>x</i>^2 and you have a point (1, 1) on it,
你有一条曲线 <i>x</i>^2 上面有一个点 （1，1）

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and you want to work out the slope at that point.
而你要在这一点上计算出坡度

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
At the moment, the slope is 3.618 for the secant,
目前 秒速时时彩开奖走势图的斜率为 3.618

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
but what I’ll do now is I’ll try and bring the point <i>Q</i> closer to <i>P</i>,
但我现在要做的是 我将试着使 <i>Q</i> 点接近 <i>P</i>

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and as I bring it closer, the value of the slope
当我把它拉近 斜率的值

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
approaches the correct value, which is eventually 2.
接近正确值 最终是 2

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That’s the idea of slope at a point.
这就是一点上的斜率的概念

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You take secant lines, and then you take the limit of those lines
你把割线 然后你把这些线的极限

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
as you approach the point.
接近该点时

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A similar idea can be used for areas; namely, break up the areas
对于区域也可以采用类似的思路 即把区域打散

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
into separate rectangles, and then you add up all those rectangle areas
成单独的矩形 然后将所有这些矩形面积相加

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and then you get an approximate area for the region.
然后你就可以得到该区域的大致面积

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
For example, if you take the same curve and you break it up
例如 如果你把同一条曲线拆开 你就会发现

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
into four rectangles over here, then you see that the area approximately,
在这里拆分成成四个长方形 然后你看大概的面积

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
but of course a wide space tells you that
但当然 广阔的空间告诉你

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
there is some error in the approximation.
近似值有一定的误差

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now if you take more rectangles—let’s say you take 10 rectangles—
现在如果你取更多的矩形 比方说你取 个矩形 就会有更多的矩形

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
you will get a better approximation, and then as you increase
你会得到一个更好的近似值 然后随着你增加

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the number of rectangles, you will get a better and better approximation, hopefully.
矩形的数量 你会得到一个更好的和更好的近似值

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That’s the idea of area which we want to explore.
这就是我们想要探索的区域理念

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let’s begin now with a parabola again and try and work with rectangles
现在我们再从抛物线开始 试着用长方形来进行处理

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
which have the top-left corner at the point on the curve.
其中左上角为曲线上的点

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What you see here is that in this case, you actually have
你在这里看到的是 在这种情况下 你实际上有

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
an underestimation of the total area, so the answer which you get is less than the total area.
低估的总面积 所以你得到的答案是小于总面积的。

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
For example,  in this case your corners are at 0, 0.2, et cetera,
例如 在这种情况下 你的角在 0 0.2 等等

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and you can work out the area.
你就可以计算出面积

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Then you get back the answer, 0.21875.
然后你会得到答案 0.21875

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Those over here are just the function values.
这边的只是函数值

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay. On the other hand, if you took the top-right corner for each rectangle,
另一方面 如果你看每个矩形的右上角

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
then you can see you’re going to overestimate the area under the curve,
那么你可以看到你会高估曲线下的面积

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
so in this case you get back the answer, 0.46875.
所以在这种情况下 你得到的答案 0.46875

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It looks like the answer would lie somewhere between 0.21875 and 0.46875.
看来答案应该在 0.21875 和 0.46875 之间

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That’s the conclusion from the earlier slide which I am repeating over here again.
这就是前面幻灯片的结论 我在这里再重复一遍

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What happens as you increase the number of rectangles?
当你增加矩形的数量时会发生什么？

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, you see over here that as you have a larger and larger number
嗯 你看这里 当你有一个越来越大的数量

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
of rectangles, then the lower and the upper estimates become closer and closer,
的矩形 那么下限和上限的估计就会越来越接近

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and they are almost identical eventually.
而且它们最终几乎完全相同

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The plots over here show you what’s happening over here.
这边的剧情让你看到这边的情况

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
As you have a larger number of rectangles,
由于你的矩形数量较多

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you get a better and better approximation to the area,
你会得到一个更好的近似的区域

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and finally it looks like you actually get the area.
最后看来你真的得到了这个区域

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But that only happens when you take a limit.
但这只有在你施加约束时才会发生

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The area will approach 1/3, but that will only actually happen if you take a limit.
面积会接近 1/3 但这只有在你施加约束时才会真正发生

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Here’s a required limit. 1/<i>n</i> is the width of each rectangle,
这里有一个必要的约束 1/<i>n</i> 是每个矩形的宽度

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and that’s the functional value, the height.
而这就是功能函数 高度。

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The limit over here is 1/3—that’s the upper limit—and the lower limit
这里的限制是 1/3 这是上限

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
would be to take the other end of the rectangle,
也是下限将是取长方形的另一端

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and then you get back 1/3 as the answer in this case as well.
然后在这种情况下 你也会得到 1/3 的答案

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay. Now to get a bit more general, I need to talk about so-called Riemann sums.
好吧 现在说得更笼统一点 我需要谈谈所谓的黎曼和。

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Now this is a fairly difficult concept, so let me go slowly.
现在这个概念相当难 让我慢慢说

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let’s say you have a general function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], not just a parabola,
比方说 你有一个普通的函数 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 而不仅仅是一条抛物线

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and you want to work out the area under the curve between [<i>a</I>, <i>b</i>].
你要计算 [<i>a</I>, <i>b</i>] 之间的曲线下面积

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What you do is you first break it up into <i>n</i> rectangles
您要做的是首先将其分解成 <i>n</i> 个矩形

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
so each rectangle will have a width (<i>b</I> – <i>a</i>)/<i>n</i>.
所以每个矩形的宽度为 (<i>b</I>-<i>a</i>)/<i>n</i>

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This quantity is called Δ<i>x</i>. Δ means very small.
这个量叫做 Δ<i>x</i> Δ的意思是非常小

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Now you’ve broken up your interval [<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>] into <i>n</i> smaller intervals,
现在您已经将您的区间 [<i>a</i>，<i>b</i>] 分解成 <i>n</i> 个较小的区间

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:13,000
[<i>x</i>0, <i>x</i>1], [<i>x</i>1, <i>x</i>2], et cetera, and the left endpoint is <i>a</i>, the right endpoint is <i>b</i>.
[<i>x</i>0，<i>x</i>1]，[<i>x</i>1，<i>x</i>2] 等等 左端点为 <i>a</i> 右端点为<i>b</i>

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
For each subinterval, you have the endpoints given by just adding Δ<i>x</i> every time.
对于每个子间隔 你只要每次加上 Δ<i>x</i> 就可以得到端点

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What you see over here is the area of any one rectangle
你在这里看到的是任何一个矩形的面积

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
will be the width of the rectangle times the height.
将是矩形的宽度乘以高度

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let’s say if you work with the right-aligned rectangles,
比方说 如果你用右对齐的矩形

91
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
then that height will be <i>f</i>[<i>xi</i>].
那么该高度将是 <i>f</i>[<i>xi</i>]

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That’s the total area, the sum, but if you work out the left-aligned rectangles,
这就是总面积 总和 但如果你把左对齐的矩形计算出来

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
then you get a similar sum, but with <i>xi</i> – 1 as the point which you evaluate.
那么你就会得到一个类似的和 但是用 <i>xi</i> - 1 作为你评估的点

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
These sums are called Riemann sums because
这些和被称为黎曼和 因为

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
they were discovered by the famous German mathematician Bernhard Riemann.
它们是由德国著名数学家 伯恩哈德·黎曼 发现的

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Here’s an example that shows what’s happening.
这里有一个例子可以说明发生了什么

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You have the curve Sin[<i>x</i>] + 2, and you want to see what happens
你有一条曲线 Sin[<i>x</i>]+2 你想看看会发生什么事？

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
as you increase the number of rectangles.
当你增加矩形的数量时

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let’s play the animation.
我们来播放动画

100
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You see that you get a better limit approximation
你看 你会得到一个更好的极限近似

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
as you increase the number of rectangles.
当你增加矩形的数量时。

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But of course, things are not so simple because at some places,
但当然，事情并不那么简单，因为在一些地方。

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
you get a slightly smaller area, and at some others,
你得到的面积稍小，而在其他一些。

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
you overestimate the area.
你高估了面积。

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay. Now we can make a formal definition of area.
好了，现在我们可以给面积下个正式定义了。现在我们可以给面积下一个正式的定义。

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The area under the curve is defined by
曲线下的面积定义为

107
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
the limit of the sum of the areas of the rectangles.
矩形面积之和的极限。

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Now that’s the case for right-aligned because you’re working with <i>f</i>[<i>xi</i>],
现在是右对齐的情况，因为你是在用<i>f</i>[<i>xi</i>]工作。

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
but if you want left-aligned rectangles, then you get almost the same expression,
但如果你想要左对齐的矩形，那么你得到的表达式几乎是一样的。

110
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
but now you start at 0 rather than starting at 1.
但现在你从0开始，而不是从1开始。

111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The fact is that if your function <i>f</i> is continuous,
事实上，如果你的函数<i>f</i>是连续的。

112
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
then both those limits will exist, and in fact, they’ll be equal.
那么这两个极限都将存在，事实上，它们将是平等的。

113
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You could work with those sums, or you could actually take the values
你可以用这些总和来计算，或者你可以实际取值

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
at any number in the subinterval for each <i>i</i>.
在每个<i>i</i>的子间隔中的任何数字。

115
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
These numbers are called sample points.
这些数字被称为样本点。

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
In particular, if you have right-aligned rectangles,
特别是，如果你有右对齐的矩形。

117
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
then you have the sample points <i>xi</i>, and if you have left-aligned rectangles,
然后你有样本点<i>xi</i>，如果你有左对齐的矩形。

118
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
then you have the sample points <i>xi</i> – 1.
那么你有样本点<i>xi</i> - 1。

119
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That’s the general formula for the area
这就是面积的一般公式

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
with any sample points for each subinterval.
与每个子间隔的任何样本点。

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
For example, here you have taken the sample points
例如，在这里，你已经采取了示例点

122
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
to be the midpoints of each subinterval.
为每个子区间的中点。

123
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay. Now it’s time to work out an example,
好了，现在是时候举个例子了现在是时候来举个例子了。

124
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
so let’s try to work out the area of Sin[<i>x</i>] from 0 to <i>b</i>
所以让我们试着计算出Sin[<i>x</i>]从0到<i>b</i>的面积。

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
where the number <i>b</i> lies between 0 and π.
其中数字<i>b</i>位于0和π之间。

126
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Here’s a plot. Now we break up the interval into <i>n</i> subintervals.
这是一个图。现在我们将区间分解成<i>n</i>个子区间。

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We’ll work with, let’s say, right-aligned rectangles,
我们将使用，比方说，右对齐的矩形。

128
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and you get the answer for the area as 1 – Cos[<i>b</i>].
你可以得到面积的答案为1 - Cos[<i>b</i>]。

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Of course, you could then replace the <i>b</i> with π,
当然，你可以把<i>b</i>换成π。

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and you get back a much nicer answer, which is just 2.
而你得到的答案要好得多，这只是2。

131
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That’s the power of the whole method; namely, it gives the exact answer
这就是整个方法的威力；即它给出了准确的答案。

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
under this curve between, in this case, 0 and π.
在这条曲线下，在这种情况下，0和π之间。

133
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay. Now a slightly more practical problem.
好了，现在说一个稍微实际一点的问题。现在是一个稍微实际一点的问题。

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let’s say a car moves on a highway, and you’re given the velocities
假设一辆汽车在高速公路上行驶，你得到的速度是： 1.

135
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
at different times at 10-minute intervals, and you want to work out
在不同的时间，每隔10分钟，你想锻炼出

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
the total distance covered in 100 minutes.
100分钟内的总路程。

137
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What you do is you divide by 60 over here—
你要做的是用60除以这里的...

138
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
after all, you want to work with minutes—and you take the height,
毕竟，你要用分钟来工作，而你要用高度。

139
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
so to speak, as the velocities, so you take 63, 62, 61, et cetera, from here,
可以说，作为速度， 所以你把63，62，61，等等，从这里。

140
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and you get back the sum, which is just the distance covered.
而你拿回来的总和，只是覆盖的距离。

141
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You can also take the heights to be the velocities at the right endpoints
你也可以把高度当作右端点的速度。

142
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
like I’ve done over here, in which case you get back the answer 108.33.
就像我在这里做的那样，在这种情况下，你得到的答案是108. 33。

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That’s a plot of the velocities, and we’ve worked out distance in two ways
这是速度的曲线图，我们用两种方法计算出了距离

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
using the left values and the right values.
使用左值和右值。

145
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But of course we could be more precise and assume that the velocity
但当然我们可以更精确地假设，速度为

146
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
is given by a certain function, in which case you could work out
是由某个函数给出的，在这种情况下，你可以计算出

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
the distance by a similar method as earlier on.
用类似前面的方法来计算距离。

148
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You take the limit of the sum, and then velocities must be then
你取和的极限，那么速度一定是那么的

149
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
found out at those values over here.
发现在这些值在这里。

150
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Then you get back the answer as 109.394 in this case.
那么在这种情况下，你得到的答案是109.394。

151
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That’s a plot of velocity, and the area under the curve in this case
那是速度的曲线图，在这种情况下，曲线下的面积。

152
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
will give you the distance covered in that interval of time.
将给你在该时间段内所覆盖的距离。

153
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That brings me to the end of this lesson.
至此，本课结束。

154
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Basically, finding area is a very practical matter.
基本上，寻找面积是一件非常实际的事情。

155
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You’ve done it forever, so to speak,
可以说，你已经做了一辈子了。

156
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
from, let’s say, middle school all the way up.
从，比方说，初中一直到。

157
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But to work out the area under a general curve,
但为了求出一般曲线下的面积。

158
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
you must divide into rectangles and then add those areas up.
你必须分成长方形，然后把这些区域加起来。

159
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Finally, we are doing calculus, so you must take the limit
最后，我们在做微积分，所以你一定要把极限

160
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
as those rectangle numbers approach infinity,
当这些矩形数字接近无穷大时。

161
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and then you get the real area under the curve.
然后你就可以得到曲线下的实际面积。

162
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Now, these sums that you compute are called Riemann sums
现在，你计算的这些和叫做黎曼和。

163
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
in honor of the mathematician Riemann,
为了纪念数学家黎曼。

164
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and these Riemann sums can also be used to work out
而这些黎曼和也可以用来计算出

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the total distance traveled when you are given only the velocity.
当你只给你速度时，总的移动距离。

166
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That’s the end of this lesson.
这节课就到此为止。

167
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The next lesson will talk about Riemann sums in more detail,
下节课将详细讲黎曼和。

168
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
but before doing that, there will be a problem session,
但在做之前，会有一个问题环节。

169
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
which you should certainly look at and understand the topic in much greater detail.
你一定要看清楚，更详细地了解这个话题。

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
谢谢你了我会在这里停下来。
