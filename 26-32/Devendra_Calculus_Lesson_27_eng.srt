00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 27 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好，这里是 Wolfram U的微积分入门，第27课

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic of this lesson is the substitution rule.
本次课程的主题是 换元法

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.
让我们从本课的简要概述开始

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the last lesson, we talked about
上节课我们说到了

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
some rules for calculating integrals,
一些计算积分的规则

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we learned a few simple rules.
我们学了几个简单的

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For example, we can now do the integral of <i>x</i>^2 and get back <i>x</i>^3/3,
比如我们现在可以计算 {\i1}x{\i}^2 的积分得到 {\i1}x{\i}^3/3

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so that’s <i>x</i>^<i>a</i> giving you <i>x</i>^(<i>a</i> + 1)/(<i>a</i> + 1), the power rule.
所以 {\i1}x{\i}^{\i1}a{\i} 的积分是 {\i1}x{\i}^({\i1}a{\i} + 1)/({\i1}a{\i} + 1)，这是幂规则

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The rules we learned cannot help us in more difficult cases.
这个规则对于更难的情况无能为力

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
For example, if I gave you the function 10Sin[3<i>x</i>],
例如 给你的函数是 10Sin[3{\i1}x{\i}]

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
then those rules would not work, and they will not work
那些规则就不能用了，将来也做不了

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
for this harder problem involving a square root radical.
包含平方根根式的这个难题

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Here are the functions and their plots.
这里有函数和他的图像

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What you notice is that these are quite interesting functions,
注意到这些是非常有趣的一些函数

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
so surely you would like to integrate them.
因此 你当然希望能把他们积出来

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The question is how do we do that,
问题是我该怎么算

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and that is the goal of this lesson.
这就是这节课的目标

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The goal of this lesson is to try and calculate such integrals
这节课我们要计算那些积分

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
using what is called the substitution rule.
使用 换元法

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But to do that, I must recall the chain rule for you.
但是事先，必须复习一下链式法则

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The chain rule says that if you have two functions, <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>
链式法则是说如果有两个函数 {\i1}f{\i} 和 {\i1}g{\i}

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
—so you have <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] and <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]—then the derivative of the composition
——所以你现在有 {\i1}f{\i}[{\i1}x{\i}] 和 {\i1}g{\i}[{\i1}x{\i}]——然后他们的 复合函数 的导数

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
<i>f</i>[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]] is <i>f</i>'[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]] * <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>].
{\i1}f{\i}[{\i1}g{\i}[{\i1}x{\i}]] 的导数是 {\i1}f{\i}'[{\i1}g{\i}[{\i1}x{\i}]] * {\i1}g{\i}'[{\i1}x{\i}]

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Here’s the rule a little more formally using D,
这是形式使用D的规则，

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and you get back the answer that you expected.
并且你可以得到希望的答案

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now of course, every time you have
在今天的课上 每当你用了

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
a rule for derivatives like this one,
类似刚才那个求导法则

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
then you have a rule for integration, so now that says that
那你有有了一个积分法 换句话说

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the integral of <i>f</i>'[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]] * <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>] is <i>f</i>[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]],
积分 {\i1}f{\i}'[{\i1}g{\i}[{\i1}x{\i}]] * {\i1}g{\i}'[{\i1}x{\i}] 得 {\i1}f{\i}[{\i1}g{\i}[{\i1}x{\i}]]

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and that is the basis for the substitution rule.
就是 换元法 的基础

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let’s go a little deeper and talk about the substitution rule.
我们稍微深入讨论一下 换元法

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let’s say you want to evaluate this integral over here.
假设要算这个积分

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What we’ll do is to simplify things, we’ll set <i>u</i> to be <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>].
简单的 设 {\i1}g{\i}[{\i1}x{\i}] 为 {\i1}u{\i}

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Now you get <i>f</i>'[<i>u</i>], and you’ll get this <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>.
现在有 {\i1}f{\i}'[{\i1}u{\i}] 并且有 {\i1}g{\i}'[{\i1}x{\i}]{\i1}dx{\i}

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But then if you think about it, the derivative of <i>u</i> is <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>],
但是考虑到 {\i1}u{\i} 的导数是 {\i1}g{\i}'[{\i1}x{\i}]

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
so that says that roughly speaking, <i>du</i> = <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>.
不加证明的有 {\i1}du{\i} = {\i1}g{\i}'[{\i1}x{\i}]{\i1}dx{\i}

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That’s a differential statement, but it’s correct.
这是（导数的）另外一种说法而已，没错

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Basically what we’ve done is
基本上 我们要做的就是

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
to reduce this rather difficult-looking integral on the left
简化左边这个看起来更麻烦的积分

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
to a rather simple-looking integral on the right,
得到右边这个看起来简单点的积分

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and that is the substitution rule for integrals.
这就是 积分换元法

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For example, if I said find the integral of 3Sin[3<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>,
比如 积分 3Sin[3{\i1}x{\i}]{\i1}dx{\i}

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
then you set <i>u</i> to be 3<i>x</i>.
设 3{\i1}x{\i} 为 {\i1}u{\i}

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So <i>du</i> is 3<i>dx</i> because that’s the derivative of 3<i>x</i>.
因此 {\i1}du{\i} 就是 3{\i1}dx{\i} ，是 3{\i1}x{\i} 的导数

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That 3 over here and the <i>dx</i> over there combine, and you get Sin[<i>u</i>]<i>du</i>.
这边的 3 和 {\i1}dx{\i} 一结合 就得到 Sin[{\i1}u{\i}]{\i1}du{\i}

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Then we can’t stop over here because <i>u</i> is 3<i>x</i>,
然后还没结束，因为 {\i1}u{\i} 是 3{\i1}x{\i}

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
so the answer is –Cos[3<i>x</i>].
答案是  –Cos[3{\i1}x{\i}]

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can check that directly with Integrate,
你可以直接用 Integrate 来验算

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and you do get back the right answer.
得到的是同样的答案

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That’s the rule for substitution,
这就叫 换元法

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
namely, you set <i>u</i> to be <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>] and then proceed from there.
将 {\i1}g{\i}[{\i1}x{\i}] 设为 {\i1}u{\i} 然后继续

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
As an example, let’s take another trig function, 10Sin[3<i>x</i>].
例如 对另一个三角函数 10Sin[3{\i1}x{\i}]

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Again, you set <i>u</i> to be 3<i>x</i>, so <i>du</i> is 3<i>dx</i>.
再一次，我们设 3{\i1}x{\i} 为 {\i1}u{\i} 因此 {\i1}du{\i} 就是 3{\i1}dx{\i}

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But then you have a 10 over here, so you make a small adjustment
但是你这里是 10（不是 3 ）就需要做点调整

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and write it as (10/3) * 3, and so you get back that
改写为 (10/3) * 3 这就回到刚才了

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the integral really is (10/3)Sin[<i>u</i>].
积分是 (10/3)Sin[{\i1}u{\i}]

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You integrate that, but then recall that <i>u</i> is 3<i>x</i>,
积出来后 回想 {\i1}u{\i} 是 3{\i1}x{\i}

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
so you plug that back in and you get back the exact answer,
再重新代回去就得到最后答案

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
which is what Integrate would give you if you tried it directly.
和你直接用 Integrate 算的一样

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay. Let’s go a step further now
好 我们更进一步

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and talk about an algebraic function.
讨论代数函数

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That’s the second function from the introduction.
这是介绍中的第二个函数

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Here you think of this inside the square root sign as being <i>u</i>,
这里将根式里的东西设为 {\i1}u{\i}

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
so <i>u</i> is <i>x</i>^3 + 3.
于是 {\i1}u{\i} 就是 {\i1}x{\i}^3 + 3

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So <i>du</i> = 3<i>x</i>^2<i>dx</i> because that’s the derivative of 3<i>x</i>^3 + 3,
所以  {\i1}du{\i} = 3{\i1}x{\i}^2{\i1}dx{\i} 因为它是 3{\i1}x{\i}^3 + 3 的导数

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
but then you think to yourself you’ve got a 2 over here,
但是你自己看这里有个 2

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
so we need a small adjustment.
所以 微调一下

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We’ll add to this 2/3 * 3, so you have that
改写为 2/3 * 3，就有

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
the integral is 2/3√<i>u</i> with respect to <i>u</i>.
这个积分是 2/3√{\i1}u{\i} 里面带着 {\i1}u{\i}

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You plug in the expression for <i>u</i>
把 {\i1}u{\i} 的式子代回去

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and you get back the answer in terms of <i>x</i>,
得到的就是以 {\i1}x{\i} 为变量的答案

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and of course Integrate gives just the same answer in this case.
当然 Integrate 这时候给出了相同的答案

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let’s now go on to a slightly harder example
我们看一个稍有难度的例子

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
where you have a kind of rational algebraic function.
是这种根式型函数

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Here you set <i>u</i> to be 5 – 5<i>x</i>^2,
设 5 – 5{\i1}x{\i}^2 是 {\i1}u{\i}

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
so <i>du</i> is –10<i>xdx</i> because that’s the derivative of <i>u</i>.
所以 {\i1}du{\i} 是 –10{\i1}xdx{\i}，是 {\i1}u{\i} 的导数

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Then you tell yourself that you have a 2<i>x</i> over here,
然后你告诉自己这里有个 2{\i1}x{\i}

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
so we need a small adjustment, so that is (–2/10) *  –10,
因此做点调整，改写成 (–2/10) *  –10

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and you get back the integral of <i>u</i> over here.
你就得到了 {\i1}u{\i} 的积分

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You plug in the expression for <i>u</i> as 5 – 5<i>x</i>^2,
将 {\i1}u{\i} 就是 5 – 5{\i1}x{\i}^2 代回去

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and of course integrate will give you back
当然 Integrate 也能给你积出来

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
just the same answer in this case.
答案一样

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay. Slightly harder example: you have <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^3√(3 – <i>x</i>^2).
好，再难一点：考虑 {\i1}f{\i}[{\i1}x{\i}] = {\i1}x{\i}^3√(3 – {\i1}x{\i}^2)

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You set <i>u</i> to be 3 – <i>x</i>^2.
设 3 – {\i1}x{\i}^2 为 {\i1}u{\i}

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That’s what’s inside the square root sign.
这就是根式里的东西

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So <i>du</i> is –2<i>xdx</i>.
所以 {\i1}du{\i} 就是 –2{\i1}xdx{\i}

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Now another problem: you need to integrate the <i>x</i>^3 carefully
现在的另一个问题是：要小心的去积分 {\i1}x{\i}^3

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
as the –2<i>x</i> bit from here and the part that’s left over,
从这里的 –2{\i1}x{\i} 到剩下的部分

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
which is <i>x</i>^2, but <i>x</i>^2 is just 3 – <i>u</i>,
是 {\i1}x{\i}^2，但是 {\i1}x{\i}^2 就是 3 – {\i1}u{\i}

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and that’s how I get the part over here.
这就是我如何得到了这一项

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The integral becomes (–1/2)(3 – <i>u</i>)√<i>u</i>.
积分变为 (–1/2)(3 – {\i1}u{\i})√{\i1}u{\i}

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You integrate that.
你把它积出来了

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You plug in the expression, and of course Integrate will give you
你代回去，当然 Integrate 也能给你

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
just the same answer in this case as well.
算出相同的答案

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, there’s a slight difference because you have
哦，这里有一点不一样 因为

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
a negative sign inside over here and outside,
内外都有一个负号

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
but essentially they are the same answer.
但是事实上是一个答案

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now the point is that you have two answers,
现在的重点是 两个答案

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
one in terms of <i>u</i> and the other in terms of <i>x</i>.
一个被 {\i1}u{\i} 表示 一个被 {\i1}x{\i} 表示

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
As far as this example goes, it’s the <i>x</i> answer that matters,
就本例而言，最重要的是由 {\ i1} x {\ i} 表示的答案

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
but when you go on to definite integrals,
但是当你继续做定积分的时候

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
then you want to actually plug in limits, and at that point,
你实际上想确定上下限 在那一点

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
we have two ways of going about it.
我们有两种方式去得到它

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
First of all, what you could do is
第一种 你可以这样做

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
you could work with the expression involving <i>x</i>, the <i>x</i> answer,
你可以用含  {\i1}x{\i} 的表达式 带 {\i1}x{\i} 的答案

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and plug in the upper and lower limits.
然后加上限和下限

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let’s say you want to go from 0 to 1.
比如我们想从 0 到 1

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You plug in the value of the <i>x</i> answer at 1 and then at 0,
你就要把 {\i1}x{\i} 的值代为 1 和 0

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and you get back the answer over here.
然后就能得到答案

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But you could also keep the <i>u</i> form, and if you do that,
但是你也可以保留  {\i1}u{\i}，如果你这么做

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you’ve got to be careful because when <i>x</i> goes from 0 to 1,
你就要小心一点，当  {\i1}x{\i} 取 0 和 1 的时候

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
then <i>u</i> goes from 3 to 2.
{\i1}u{\i} 取的是 3 和 2

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That’s because <i>u</i> is defined in terms of <i>x</i>.
这是因为 {\i1}u{\i}  是由 {\i1}x{\i} 的式子定义的

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Here’s the answer again from the <i>u</i> method,
用 {\i1}u{\i} 方法得到的还是这个答案

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and you get back just the same result.
你得到相同的结果

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You can check it all with Integrate, and you have
你可以用 Integrate 验算 你有

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
the first answer is the <i>u</i> answer going from 3 to 2.
第一个答案是 {\i1}u{\i} 从 3 到 2

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The other one is from 0 to 1 for <i>x</i>,
另一个是  {\i1}x{\i} 从 0 到 1

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and you get back the same result in both the cases.
两种算法答案相同

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The point is that when you have a definite integral,
重点是当你做定积分时

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
then you could either work in the <i>u</i> picture or the <i>x</i> picture,
你可以用 {\i1}u{\i} 的图 或者是 {\i1}x{\i} 的图

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and they are both convenient in some ways.
他们在某些时候都很方便

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The <i>u</i> answer tends to be simpler,
{\i1}u{\i} 答案往往更简单

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
but you need to change the limits.
但是你要小心上下限的变化

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The <i>x</i> answer tends to be more complicated,
{\i1}x{\i} 答案更复杂

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
but then you have the limits given to you.
但是上下限是直接给出的

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You should decide which one is better in each case.
应该每次都选较好的方式去做

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That brings me to the end of this lesson.
课就到这里了

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The main point is the substitution rule lets you
重点是 换元法 让你

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
calculate integrals using the chain rule in reverse.
计算积分的时候逆用链式法则

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This rule is essentially a reverse chain rule.
换元法的实质就是逆用链式法则

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What you do is you always begin by making a substitution <i>u</i>,
始终从做换元 {\ i1} u {\ i} 开始

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
a suitable one.
一个合适的换元

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Then you find <i>du</i> and modify the integral as required.
然后计算 {\ i1} du {\ i} 并根据需要改写积分

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Then you plug back the expression for <i>u</i> after integrating
积分完代入 {\i1}u{\i} 的表达式

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and you get back the result.
就能得到结果

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But of course when working with definite integrals,
但是 在做定积分时

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you could either work with the original endpoints and <i>x</i>,
即可以用原上下限和 {\ i1} x {\ i}，

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
or change the endpoints and work with <i>u</i>.
也能改变形式用 {\i1}u{\i}

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That’s the essence of this rule.
这是这条规则的本质

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
In the next lesson, we’ll apply these ideas
下节课 我们会用这个方法

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
to compute the area between two curves.
计算两条曲线之间的面积

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But before doing that, do review the lesson.
但是在此之前 好好复习

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It’s quite a difficult lesson because you’ll need this rule
这是非常困难的一课 因为你需要用这个方法

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
again and again, and you must have some practice with applying it.
算一遍又一遍 你必须做一些练习来用它

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
本节课到此为止，再见
