00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 29 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好，这里是 Wolfram U 的微积分入门第 29 课

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic for this lesson is volumes of solids.
本次课程的主题是 立体体积

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of today’s lesson.
让我们从本课的简要概述开始

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Thus far we’ve been talking about the area under curves,
到目前为止 我们一直在讨论曲线下的面积

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and we’ve used integral calculus for doing that.
并且我们已经会使用积分来计算

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For example, if you work out this integral over here,
例如 如果在此计算积分

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
then what you’re really doing is
那么真正在做的是

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
to work out the area under the curve <i>y</i> = <i>x</i>^2 between 2 and 3.
计算出在 2 和 3 之间曲线 <i>y</i> = <i>x</i>^2 下的面积

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The point is that you can also use integral calculus
关键是你也可以使用积分

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to find the volume of solids, and that would be
计算立体的体积 那将是

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
a big advancement if we could learn it.
大的进步 要是我们能掌握的话

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let’s look at a very simple example of a solid like over here.
来看一个非常简单的例子 比如这个立体

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What we can do is we can actually calculate
实际上我们可以算

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the volume of this solid or others using calculus.
这个立体或其他立体的体积 通过使用微积分

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This lesson is about one method for computing such volumes.
这节课就是关于如何计算这些体积的

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The solid that we spoke of just now was a cylinder of course,
刚才我们说的立体当然是圆柱体

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and if you think of a cylinder, it can be constructed
当你想到一个圆柱体 就可以构造出来

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
by taking a plane region, and then you sweep out a volume.
通过先画一个平面 然后扫出一个体积

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
For example, let’s say you take this disk over here
例如 在这里放一个圆盘

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and you sweep out a volume up to a certain height
然后扫出一个有一定高度的体积

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and you get a cylinder.
你就得到了一个圆柱

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That’s a hint for finding the volume of a cylinder;
这就是求圆柱体积的提示

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
namely, you think of it as being composed of disks.
即 当他是由圆盘组成的

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you want to find the volume of a cylinder, what you do is
如果要求圆柱的体积 就要

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
you take the base area
找到底面积

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and then multiply it by the height to get the volume.
然后乘以高即可得到体积

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
For example, here’s a disk.
例如 这个圆盘

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can work out its area,
可以算出他的面积

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and that’s a cylinder with that disk as a base and height 4,
那这就是以该圆为底高度为 4 的圆柱体

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and its volume is 4π.
他的体积是 4π

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Basically the volume of the cylinder is
基本上 圆柱的体积是

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the area of the base times the height, which is 4 in this case.
底面积乘高 这里高是 4

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now of course there are many more
当然现在还有更多的

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
shapes and solids in the Wolfram Language
形状和立体定义在 Wolfram 语言中

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and you can work out their volumes directly,
可以直接计算出他们的体积

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
but what you might want to do is to work out
但是你可能想算

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
the volumes of even more general solids.
更多的一般的固体的体积

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Here’s an example.
例如

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You have a three-dimensional region.
有一个三维区域

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you look at this region, you think of it
观察这个区域 就会发现

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
as being composed of square cross sections.
他是由正方形横截面组成的

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you were to slice the region, you would see that
对这个区域进行切片 就能看到

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
the area of each piece is 4<i>x</i>^2 because you have
每一片的面积是 4<i>x</i>^2 因为你的

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
squares with lengths and widths of 2<i>x</i>.
正方形长宽都是 2<i>x</i>

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The volume of each piece would be 4<i>x</i>^2Δ<i>x</i>,
每一片的体积就是 4<i>x</i>^2Δ<i>x</i>

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and then you can add them all up, so to speak,
所以说 把他们全加起来 

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and get the total volume to be the integral of 4<i>x</i>^2<i>dx</i>
就得到整个体积是 4<i>x</i>^2<i>dx</i> 的积分

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
between the right limits.
在确定的上下限之间

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
For example, if you want to define the limits as 1 and 3,
例如 如果确定上下限是 1 和 3

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
then the volume is 104/3.
那体积就是 104/3

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay. Now let’s try and generalize that a bit more.
好 现在我们尝试进一步概括一下

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you have a solid with cross-section area <i>A</i>[<i>x</i>],
如果固体的 横截面 面积为 <i>A</i>[<i>x</i>]

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
then its volume is the integral from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> of <i>A</i>(<i>x</i>)<i>dx</i>
那他的体积就是 <i>A</i>(<i>x</i>)<i>dx</i> 在 <i>a</i> 到 <i>b</i> 上的积分

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the limits within which you want to find the volume.
这里 <i>a</i> 和 <i>b</i> 是你想求的体积的上下限

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
For example, if you want to find the volume of a ball
例如 想求球的体积

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
like over here and the radius is <i>r</i>,
就像在这里 半径是 <i>r</i>

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
then each cross section has got a radius of √(<i>r</i>^2 – <i>x</i>^2).
那么每个横截面的半径为 √(<i>r</i>^2 – <i>x</i>^2)

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So the cross sections of the left end have got very small areas.
因此 左端的横截面面积很小

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
As you go to the middle, the area increases.
当回到中间时 面积会变大

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Basically, the area will be π(<i>r</i>^2 – <i>x</i>^2).
基本上 面积是 π(<i>r</i>^2 – <i>x</i>^2)

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You add them all up and you get the volume of the ball,
全部加在一起就得到球的体积

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
which is of course (4π<i>r</i>^3)/3.
当然就是 (4π<i>r</i>^3)/3

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You can check that with Volume and get back just the same result.
可以用 Volume 进行验算 并得到相同的结果

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay. Let’s use the same idea to talk about
好 来用类似的思路来讨论

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
what are called solves of revolutions.
所谓旋转体的处理

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Here’s a function, and what you can do is
这个函数 我们能做的是

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
you can take the graph of this function
可以画出函数图像

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and revolve it around the <i>x</i> axis, and then you get a solid.
然后以 <i>x</i> 为轴旋转 就得到一个旋转体

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Here’s how we do it.
这里怎么做呢

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You use RevolutionPlot3D, and you get this solid
使用 RevolutionPlot3D 就能得到他

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
obtained by revolving the curve about the <i>x</i> axis.
通过绕 <i>x</i> 旋转得到

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Of course you could also revolve it around the <i>y</i> axis
当然你也可以绕 <i>y</i> 轴旋转得到

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and get a slightly different solid.
一个略有不同的形状

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The question is how do you work out the volume in these cases?
问题是 在这些情况下如何求体积

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay. What you do is you can again divide the volume into disks,
好 再一次我们划分体积为圆盘

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but in this case, each cross section is a disk whose radius is <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>],
但是现在 每个横截面都是半径为 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 圆盘

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
the value of the function <i>f</i> at <i>x</i>, so the volume will be
在 <i>x</i> 处的函数值为 <i>f</i> 所以体积是

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the integral from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> of π<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]^2<i>dx</i>.
π<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]^2<i>dx</i> 在 <i>a</i> 到 <i>b</i> 间的积分

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let’s say you want to find the volume from –1 to 1.
假设要求 -1 到 1 之间的体积

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We get back the integral over here, which is 2π/5.
回到这个积分上 体积就是 2π/5

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Just to remind you, that was the original parabola,
只是提醒你一下 那是原来的抛物线

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and that was the solid obtained by revolving around the <i>x</i> axis.
这是围绕 <i>x</i> 轴旋转获得的固体

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now you might, let’s say, want to revolve it around the line <i>y</i> = 1,
现在 可能你想 绕 <i>y</i> = 1 旋转

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
in which case you just subtract off 1
这时你只需要减去 1

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
because if you look at the volume over here,
因为你看这个体积公式

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you see that you actually have different radii
你看实际上半径是不同的

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
depending upon where you are.
取决于你的位置

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Basically you shift down the function by one
基本上 你把函数向下移动一个单位

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
to get the correct picture.
就得到了正确的图像

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Then the radius of each cross section is 1 – <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>],
然后每个横截面半径为 1 – <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
so you can work out the volume as the integral of π(1 – <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>])^2
因此 可以将体积视为 π(1 – <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>])^2 的积分

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
between the correct limits.
在这个决定的范围里

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Similarly, if you want to find, let’s say,
同样 比如你想求 比如

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
the volume obtained by revolving around the line <i>y</i> = –1,
围绕 <i>y</i> = –1 旋转所得的体积

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
then you add a 1.
那你加 1 就行

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Here’s the picture.
这是图像

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Again, work out the volume with an integral
还是 用积分算体积

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and you get back the answer.
你可以得到这个答案

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Basically, shift the function up by 1 in this case.
基本上 在这种情况下 将函数向上移动 1

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Now a second method for computing volumes
现在计算体积的第二个方法

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
is the so-called washer method.
称之为 垫圈法

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The idea is simple.
原理很简单

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You have two functions, <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>,
有两个函数  <i>f</i> 和 <i>g</i>

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and you look at the area between them
来看他们之间的区域

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and then you revolve it around the <i>x</i> axis.
然后绕 <i>x</i> 轴旋转

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Here’s a nice demonstration of that.
这里有一个很好的演示

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You revolve it. It sweeps out the volume.
旋转他 扫出一个体积

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The question is how do you work out a formula for that volume?
问题是如何得到这个体积的计算公式

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What you do is you remind yourself that now each cross section
你要做的就是提醒自己 现在每个横截面

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
is like a washer because it’s got a kind of outer and inner radius.
像是一个垫圈 因为他有这种内径和外径

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That’s the area of this washer.
底面积就是这个

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We work out the integral for the volume,
我们算出这个体积的积分

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and that’s the method for finding the volume using the washer method.
这就是使用垫圈法求体积的方法

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But of course we might have liked to go around the <i>y</i> axis,
当然 我们也能绕 <i>y</i> 轴转

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
in which case we do just the opposite.
这时我们要做的恰恰相反

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You write <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> as functions of <i>y</i>
将 <i>f</i> 和 <i>g</i> 写为 <i>y</i> 的函数

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and then do a similar integral to get back the answer.
然后求一个类似的积分来得到答案

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That brings me to the end of the lesson.
这节课就到这儿了

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The main point is that you can use integrals
要点是 可以使用积分

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
to find the volumes of solids,
来算固体的体积

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and that’s quite a powerful idea.
这是相当强大的一个思想

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let’s say if you have a cylinder, then its volume is base times height,
假设有一个圆柱体 那么他的体积就是简单乘高

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
where <i>B</i> is the area of the base.
这里 <i>B</i> 是底面积

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If you have a more general solid with the cross-sectional area <i>A</i>[<i>x</i>],
如果更一般的固体的横截面面积是 <i>A</i>[<i>x</i>]

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
then you’ll compute an integral to find the volume.
那就能算个积分来求体积

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If you have a solid of revolution
如果是旋转体

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
obtained by revolving the function around a certain line,
是函数通过绕某条确定直线旋转得到的

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
then you can compute its volume using the formula over here.
那你就可以用这个公式来计算

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Typically you might just want <i>y</i> to be 0,
通常 可能设 <i>y</i> 是 0

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
so you’re revolving around the <i>x</i> axis.
所以就是绕 <i>x</i> 轴旋转

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you have two functions
如果你有两个函数

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and you want to revolve the area between them,
想算他们之间区域的旋转体

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
then you apply the washer method and apply the formula over here.
然后使用垫圈法 在这里套用公式

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Of course you can repeat the same thing
当然可以重复相同的事情

135
