00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 30 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好，这里是 Wolfram U的微积分入门，第30课

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is volumes by cylindrical shells.
本次课程的主题是 柱壳法求体积

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.
先简单回顾一下上节课

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In the previous lesson, we learned about the disk and washer methods
在上一课中 我们学了圆盘法和垫圈法

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
for finding the volumes of solids.
来计算固体体积

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
As an example of the disk method,
作为圆盘法的示例

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
let’s say you have the function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^2
假设有函数 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>x</i>^2

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and you rotate that around the <i>x</i> axis from 1 to 4.
绕 <i>x</i> 轴旋转后在 1 到 4 之间
9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You get a solid of this type.
可以得到这种图形

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
To find the volume, what you do is you break up the solid into disks,
要算体积 你需要将他分解为圆盘

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and each disk then has a radius of <i>x</i>^2, the value of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>],
每一个圆盘的半径是 <i>x</i>^2 就是 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 的值

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
so the area of this disk is π<i>r</i>^2 times, of course, the height,
所以这个圆盘的面积 π<i>r</i>^2 乘这个 高

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
which is the infinitesimal volume.
就是这个有限部分的体积

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Then you get the integral of that giving you the volume of the solid.
然后积分算出来这个固体的体积

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The washer method is very simple and similar
垫圈法也一样很简单

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
because all you do is instead of working with one disk,
因为你要做的就是不是只用一个圆盘而是

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
you simply subtract the volume of two disks, the outer and inner.
很简单的减去两个圆盘的面积 外圈盘和内圆盘

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Basically it works on washers or rings or annuli
基本上 他适用于 垫圈 环 或着 奥利奥

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
or whatever you call them.
或者随你怎么叫

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now a slightly harder example.
现在有一个稍麻烦一点的例子

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Suppose you have the function shown over here
假设有一个这里的函数

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and you want to revolve it around the <i>y</i> axis, not the <i>x</i> axis.
你想绕 <i>y</i> 轴转 而不是 <i>x</i> 轴

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Then it’s not clear what one means by the inner and outer radii.
那么内径和外径就不清楚了

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The goal of this lesson is to talk about
这节课的目标就是讨论

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
the so-called cylindrical shell method
所谓的柱壳法

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
which makes this example and similar examples very simple.
会使得这个示例和类似示例非常简单

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let’s build some intuition for the method.
我们先建立一些直觉认识

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let’s say you want to find the volume of the solid.
假设要求固体的体积

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You break it into pieces, but these pieces
将他打碎 但这些碎片

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
are now going to be shells rather than cross sections.
现在是个壳 而不是截面

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Because each cell looks like a cylinder,
因为每个微元都像一个圆桶

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
it’s called the cylindrical shell method.
就被称为 柱壳法

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Here’s a typical cylinder.
这里有一个圆桶

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It’s very thin.
他非常薄

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It has an outer radius of <i>r</i>2 and an inner radius of <i>r</i>1,
他的外半径是 <i>r</i>2 内半径 <i>r</i>1

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
so that is the difference in the volumes of outer and inner,
因此外部和内部有个体积差

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
which will give you the volume of that thin shell.
这就是薄壳的体积

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If you factor it a little bit, you could rewrite it as
如果稍微考虑一下 可以将其重写为
39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
2π<i>h</i> times the average of <i>r</i>1 and <i>r</i>2
2π<i>h</i> 乘 <i>r</i>1 和 <i>r</i>2 的均值

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
times the difference between <i>r</i>1 and <i>r</i>2 like over here.
乘 <i>r</i>1 和 <i>r</i>2 的差 像这里

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now because it’s very thin, you can let <i>r</i>2 approach <i>r</i>1,
现在因为他非常薄 我们用 <i>r</i>2 近似 <i>r</i>1

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
in which case the difference over here becomes <i>dr</i>
这里的差就变为 <i>dr</i>

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and the average becomes just <i>r</i>1.
均值就是 <i>r</i>1

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now because you only have one <i>r</i> left, you might as well call it <i>r</i>.
现在就剩一个 <i>r</i> 就将它记为 <i>r</i>

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The volume now becomes 2π<i>hrdr</i>.
体积就变为 2π<i>hrdr</i>

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The question is what’s <i>h</i>?
问题是 <i>h</i> 是多少

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, <i>h</i> is the value of the function <i>f</i> as a function of <i>r</i>.
好吧 <i>h</i> 是函数 <i>f</i> 的值 是 <i>r</i> 的函数

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The height <i>h</i> becomes now <i>f</i>[<i>r</i>],
高 <i>h</i> 就变为 <i>f</i>[<i>r</i>]

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
so you have a very nice, simple formula for the volume
所以就有一个非常好的 简单的体积公式

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
by the method of cylindrical shells.
通过 柱壳法

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
To go back to our example from the introduction,
回到介绍中我们的示例

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
you have this function, <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = 4<i>x</i>^3 – <i>x</i>^4.
函数为 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = 4<i>x</i>^3 – <i>x</i>^4

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You want to work out the volume, so you simply do 2π<i>r</i>
想算体积 只需简单的用 2π<i>r</i>

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
times the value of the function over here times <i>dr</i>.
乘 这里的函数值 乘 <i>dr</i>

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You work it out with Integrate, and you get back the result.
算个积分 就能得到答案

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay. Now the question is which method should you use,
好 现在的问题是应该使用哪种方法

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
the washer or disk method or the cylindrical shell method?
垫圈法 圆盘法 还是 柱壳法？

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let’s say here’s an example in which you have two curves,
来看这个示例 有两条曲线

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
<i>x</i>^2 and <i>x</i>^3, but you want to revolve it around the <i>y</i> axis.
<i>x</i>^2 和 <i>x</i>^3 但是你想他绕 <i>y</i> 轴旋转

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
With the washer method, you could rewrite things
由垫圈法 可以改写这件事

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
as cube roots and square roots and get the answer,
为立方根和平方根并且得到答案

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
but in this case, it’s much simpler
但是这个例子里 会更简单

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
to simply work with the cylindrical shell method,
要是简单的用一下柱壳法

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and you get back the same result.
就能得到同样的答案

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You do get the same answer, but the question is which one to use.
你确实得到了一样的答案 但是问题在于用什么方法算

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That’s up to you, but typically, the cylindrical shell method
这取决于你 但通常 柱壳法

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
works well when the axis of the cylinder
效果很好 当圆柱的轴

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
is the same as the rotation axis.
和旋转轴相同时

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay. Some minor variations.
好 小小改一下

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let’s say you have a function like over here,
假设有这样一个函数

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and you want to rotate it around the line <i>x</i> = 6
你想让他绕直线 <i>x</i> = 6 旋转

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
rather than the <i>y</i> axis, let’s say.
而不是 <i>y</i> 轴

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Then what you do first of all is you find the radius.
然后首先要做的就是找到半径

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Keep in mind that the radius is now going to be <i>6</i> – x
记住 现在半径是 <i>6</i> – x

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
because you are counting from <i>x</i> = 6, so that’s the radius.
因为你是从 <i>x</i> = 6 开始算的 所以这是半径

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You have 2π times radius times function value,
用 2π 乘 半径 乘 函数值

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and you get back the answer with the cylindrical shell method.
用柱壳法得到答案

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
On the other hand, if you have a negative axis,
另一方面如果是 负轴

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
so let’s say you have <i>x</i> = –1 over here, and you have this function.
来看这里 <i>x</i> = –1 有这些函数

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Now if you if you look at the radius, it’s going to be <i>x</i> + 1.
现在要是算半径的话 将是 <i>x</i> + 1

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Your formula is slightly different.
公式略有不同

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You have 2π(<i>x</i> + 1)<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>.
是 2π(<i>x</i> + 1)<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]<i>dx</i>

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You work out the answer, and you get back the volume in this case.
算出答案 得到了这个时候的体积

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We spoke a little earlier about comparing the two methods,
我们之前谈到了比较这两种方法，

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
washer/disk and cylinder.
垫圈/圆盘 和 柱壳

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let’s take an example
来看个例子

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
where the disk or washer method works a little better.
圆盘或垫圈方法效果更好一点

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let’s say you have <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = CubeRoot[<i>x</i>].
假设 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = CubeRoot[<i>x</i>]
89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You now revolve around the <i>x</i> axis from 0 to 1.
绕 <i>x</i> 轴旋转 在 0 和 1 之间

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
If you try the cylindrical shell method, things become a bit harder
如果尝试使用柱壳法 事情会变得有点困难

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
because now the shell height is horizontal rather than vertical.
因为现在壳的高度是水平的 而不是垂直的

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If you had to apply the cylindrical shell method,
如果必须用柱壳法

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
you would first of all rewrite the function as a function of <i>y</i>,
首先要将函数改写为 <i>y</i> 的函数

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
then work out the shell radius, then work out the integral.
然后计算出壳半径 然后计算出积分

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But with the disk method, things are much simpler
但是使用圆盘法 事情要简单得多

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
because you simply have the cube root of <i>x</i> as the function,
因为只是将 <i>x</i> 的立方根作为函数

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
so you apply π times <i>r</i>^2<i>dx</i>, integrate from 0 to 1
所以你因该用 π 乘 <i>r</i>^2<i>dx</i> 再从 0 到 1 积分

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and you get back the same volume.
得相同的答案

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
In general, both these methods—
一般而言 这两个办法

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the cylindrical shell method and the washer/disk method—
柱壳法 和 垫圈/圆盘法——

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
have advantages and disadvantages,
有优点有缺点

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and you must decide which one is better suited for your problem.
你必须决定用哪一个更适合解决问题

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of the lesson.
好 本节课就上到这儿了

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Basically, what we’ve learned is that the cylindrical shell method
基本上我们学习了柱壳法

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
is another nice way of finding the volume of solids.
是另一种求固体体积的方法

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This method works by breaking up the solid into cylindrical shells.
此方法通过将固体分解为柱壳来算

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Those shells are very, very thin, and the height of the shell
这些柱壳非常薄 并且壳的高度

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
is the value of the function.
是函数值

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Sometimes you’ll find that the cylindrical shell method
有时会发现圆柱壳法

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
is much easier, and it can be very cumbersome or even impossible
更容易 而且可能非常麻烦甚至不可能

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
to apply the disk/washer method.
应用圆盘/垫圈法

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But other times, you might find that the disk/washer method
但有时 可能会发现圆盘/垫圈法

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is a lot easier to understand and use, so you might prefer that.
易于理解和使用 因此你可能更喜欢这种方法

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Just to review the formulae for the lesson,
回顾一下本节课的公式

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
first of all if you revolve around the line <i>x</i> = <i>x</i>0
首先 如果绕线 <i>x</i> = <i>x</i>0 旋转

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
where <i>x</i>0 is positive, then you get <i>x</i>0 – <i>x</i> as the radius,
其中 <i>x</i>0 为正 那么得半径为 <i>x</i>0 – <i>x</i>

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
so think back to the example involving 6 – <i>x</i>.
请回想一下涉及  6 – <i>x</i> 的示例

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
On the other hand, if you have a negative or 0 value for <i>x</i>0,
另一方面 如果 <i>x</i>0 的值为 负 或 0

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
then you’ll have <i>x</i> – <i>x</i>0 over here, so think back to the example
那么这里有 <i>x</i> – <i>x</i>0 回想一下例子

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
which had an <i>x</i> + 1, which really was an <i>x</i> minus –1.
有 <i>x</i> + 1 的那个 实际上就是 <i>x</i> 减 –1

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Those two very simple formulae tell you what you need to do
这两个非常简单的公式告诉你需要做什么

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
for the cylindrical shell method,
对于柱壳法

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and that makes it a very simple method wherever it works.
无论怎么做 他都是非常简单的方法

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
In the next lesson, we’ll talk about
下节课 我们将讨论

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the average value of a function with integration,
积分下函数的均值

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
but before doing that, do review today’s lesson.
在此之前 请复习今天的课程

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It’s a very important lesson.
这节课非常重要

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It tells you how to find the volumes of very difficult-looking solids,
它告诉你如何计算看起来非常困难的固体的体积

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and it really shows you how powerful calculus is.
它确实展示了微积分的强大

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
 本节课到此为止，再见
