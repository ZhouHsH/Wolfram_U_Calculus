00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 31 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好 这里是 Wolfram U的微积分入门 第31课

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is average value of a function.
本次课程的主题是 函数的均值

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.
让我们从本课的简要概述开始

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let’s say you have a list of numbers like over here,
假设有一个像这样的数列

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and you want to work out their average value.
你想求他们的均值

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Of course what you do is just add the numbers
当然 只需要把数字加起来

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and then divide by the number of numbers,
然后除以数字个数

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
which is 10 in this case, and you get back the answer.
这里是 10 然后你就能得到答案

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You also have a function called Mean in the Wolfram Language
在 Wolfram 语言中 还有一个称为 Mean 的函数

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which does just the same thing for you,
做的是同一件事

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and you get back the same answer.
得到同一个答案

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now let’s say instead of a list of values,
现在说说不是数列的时候

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
you had a function like the one shown over here.
有一个像这里一样的函数

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Here’s a plot of the function.
这是函数图像

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The question is can we work out
问题是我们能否求得

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the average value of such a function?
这个函数的均值

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The answer is yes.
答案是肯定的

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Here’s some intuition.
这是直觉

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let’s say your function runs from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>.
假设函数在 <i>a</i> 和 <i>b</i> 之间

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You break the interval into <i>n</i> subintervals,
将区间分为 <i>n</i> 个子区间

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
take a sample point for each subinterval
在每个字区间中取一个采样点

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and then work out the average value like over here.
然后计算这的均值

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now we want to rewrite it as a Riemann sum,
现在我们想改写为黎曼和的形式

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
so the <i>n</i> over here can be thought of as being related to Δ<i>x</i>,
所以这里的 <i>n</i> 可以认为与 Δ<i>x</i> 有关

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
the length of each subinterval.
这是子区间长度

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So  Δ<i>x</i> is (<i>b</i> – <i>a</i>)/<i>n</i>, and hence <i>n</i> is (<i>b</i> – <i>a</i>)/Δ<i>x</i>.
因此 Δ<i>x</i> 是 (<i>b</i> – <i>a</i>)/<i>n</i> 并且得 <i>n</i> 是 (<i>b</i> – <i>a</i>)/Δ<i>x</i>

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You can rewrite the average in a slightly different form
你可以用略有不同的形式重写平均值

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
in which it’s clear that if you now let <i>n</i> go to ∞
很明显 如果现在让 <i>n</i> 趋向于 ∞

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
so you’ve got very small subintervals,
所以子区间很小

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
then what you get back is the integral
那么你得到积分

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
divided by the length of the interval.
除以区间的长度

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That’s the average value of a function.
这就是函数的均值

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It’s the integral of the function over an interval
他是在一个区间上的积分

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
divided by the length of the interval.
除以区间长度

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let’s say in our example, if you want to work out the average value,
假设对我们的例子 你要算均值

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
you simply find the integral from 0 to 5 and then divide by 5,
只需计算0到5之间的积分 然后除以5

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and you get back the answer.
就能得到答案

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay. Now a much deeper fact is
好 更深层的事实是

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
something called the mean value theorem, which says that
称为均值定理的东西

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
if you have a continuous function on an interval,
如果函数在区间上连续

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
then there is at least one number <i>c</i> in that interval
那么在区间中至少存在一个点 <i>c</i>

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
such that the value of the function is equal to the average value.
使得此点的函数值就是平均值

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That should remind you of the mean value theorem for derivatives,
这会让你想到微分均值定理

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
which was the same thing,
这是一回事

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
but now for integrals over intervals and areas rather than slopes.
但是现在是针对的是区间上的积分和面积而不是斜率

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If you multiply both sides by <i>b</i> – <i>a</i>,
如果将两边都乘以 <i>b</i> – <i>a</i>

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
what you get on the left-hand side is just the area of a rectangle
左边得到的是一个矩形的面积

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
with height <i>f</i>(<i>c</i>) and length <i>b</i> – <i>a</i>,
高是 <i>f</i>(<i>c</i>) 长为 <i>b</i> – <i>a</i>

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and the right-hand side is the integral.
然后右边是这个积分

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Here is a visual interpretation of the whole thing.
这是整个事情的可视化描述

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let’s say that this is your curve,
来看这条曲线

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and now you have the area under the curve, and that’s the rectangle.
现在有曲线下的面积 这就是矩形

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now there’s a bit of area that’s common over here,
现在这里又一些公共区域

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and then a bit over here which only belongs to the rectangle
然后在这里有些点只属于矩形

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and a bit that only belongs to the curve,
还有些点只属于曲线

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and what we’re saying over here is that the area of this rectangle
我们说在这个地方有 这个矩形的面积

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
is equal to the area under the curve.
等于曲线下的面积

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That’s quite a remarkable theorem.
这是个相当了不起的定理

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It’s very deep and shows you how powerful calculus is.
他非常深刻 并且展现了微积分的力量

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We’re able to reduce the area under a curve
我们能够简化曲线下的面积

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
to the area of a rectangle,
为矩形的面积

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
which is the simplest thing one might think about in areas.
这是人们能想到的最简单的事情

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay. As an application, here’s a function,
好 作为应用 这有一个函数

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and you want to find a value in the interval –2 to 3
要找在区间 -2 到 3 之间的一点

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
such that the function value is equal to
使得该点的函数值等于

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
the average value over that interval.
函数在这个区间上的均值

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Now because the function is continuous, it’s a polynomial,
由于函数是连续的 他是个多项式

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
so you can certainly apply the theorem, the mean value theorem.
所以当然可以应用这个定理 即均值定理

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let’s say you want to do that.
假设你要这样做

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You solve the equation <i>f</i>[<i>c</i>] equal to the average value,
解这个方程 <i>f</i>[<i>c</i>] 等于 均值

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and when you do that, you get back an answer.
等你这么做完 就能得到答案

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Here’s a plot which shows the point at which
这张图 显示了

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
the average value is actually retained.
这个均值实际上是有的

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That’s the mean value theorem in action.
这就是均值定理在起作用

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But the main point is that sometimes you can get
但是要点是有时候你可以得到

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
more than one point at which the average value is retained.
不止一个点 这些点的值都是均值

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Here’s an example.
这有一个例子

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You have a function.
这个函数

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You try and work out the average value, and then work out
试着算一下均值 然后得到

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
the point at which you want to check whether
一些点 在这些点你想检查是否

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
the average value equals the function value.
均值等于函数值

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You get two points now, and here’s a picture which says
你现在得到两个点 这张图上面说

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that you really have two points at which
你真的有两个点

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
the average value is attained.
能取到均值

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
As an application of these ideas,
作为这些思想的应用

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
here’s a temperature for a city <i>t</i> hours after noon.
这是 中午 <i>t</i> 小时后 城市的温度

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You plot the temperate from 1pm to 3am,
画出从 1pm 到 3am 的温度图像

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and the question is, is there a time at which the temperature
问题是 是否有有这么个时间 当时的温度

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
equals the average temperature?
就是一天的平均温度

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The answer is yes.
答案是肯定的

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Just solve the equation and you get back that <i>c</i> is about 8.57.
只需解方程 就能得到 <i>c</i> 约是 8.57

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That’s in hours, so that means at around 8:34pm,
以小时为单位 这意味着晚上 8:34 左右

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
the temperature will be equal to the average temperature
此时温度就是平均温度

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
over the time period.
在这一段时间中的

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
As another application, let’s look at a car on a highway.
另一个应用是 来看一下高速公路上的汽车

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Here is the velocity of the car, and you want to find
这是汽车的速度 要算

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the average velocity over the time period.
这段时间里的平均速度

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What you do is you simply integrate
你要做的就是简单的积分

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and divide by the time interval.
除以时间区间

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Here’s a plot which shows clearly that
这张图清楚的表明

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the average value is attained at two different points,
平均值能够在不同的两个点取到

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
so the average velocity is attained twice in the interval.
所以平均速度能取到两次在区间内

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That brings me to the end of this lesson,
这节课到此为止

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
but the main point for today is that with integration,
但是今天的重点是积分

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
you can find the average value of a function over an interval.
你可以找到某个区间内的函数的平均值

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That average value is given by the integral
均值的计算由这个积分

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
divided by the length of the interval.
除以区间长度得到

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The mean value theorem is a very powerful theorem
均值定理是非常有力的一个定理

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
which says that if you have a continuous function,
他表明如果有一个连续函数

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
then it takes on its average value at least once—
那他至少能取到一次他的均值

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
could be more than once, but at least once—in the interval.
在区间内可能取到不止一次 但是至少一次

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Of course once you have this very powerful theorem,
当然一旦有了这个非常强大的定理

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
you could apply it to temperatures or velocities
你可以应用到温度或速度上

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
or all kinds of other fillable phenomena.
或者其他的可填充的现象中

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You have the mean value theorem, which tells you that
均值定理 告诉你

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the area under the curve is equal to the area of a certain rectangle.
曲线下的面积等于某个矩形的面积

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That’s a very powerful theorem for calculus.
对于微积分这是非常强大的一个定理

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
In the next lesson we’ll talk about approximate values of integrals,
在下一课中 我们将讨论积分的近似

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
but for now, do review this lesson,
但现在 请务必复习本课中

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
go over the idea for the mean value
求平均值的思想

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and I’ll see you next time.
我们下次见

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
本节课到此为止，再见(翻译：周怀尚 兰州大学 校对：秦晋 北京师范大学)
