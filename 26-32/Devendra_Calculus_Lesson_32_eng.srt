00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 32 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
大家好，这里是 Wolfram U的微积分入门，第31课

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is approximate integration.
本次课程的主题是 积分近似

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.
让我们从本课的简要概述开始

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So far, you’ve been using integration to calculate
到目前为止 你一直在使用积分来算

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the area under curves, et cetera, and the point is
曲线下的面积 等等 要点是

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
if you can compute an integral, then you can work out the area.
能算出积分 就能算出面积

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
For example, if you can work out the integral of <i>x</i>^2,
例如 如果你能计算 <i>x</i>^2 的积分

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which is of course <i>x</i>^3/3, then you can work out
当然答案是 <i>x</i>^3/3 然后你就能算出

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the area under the curve for <i>y</i> = <i>x</i>^2 between,
曲线 <i>y</i> = <i>x</i>^2 下区域间的面积

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
let’s say, 2 and 5 in two ways:
假设有 2 和 5 现在有两种方法

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
either you can actually plug in the upper and lower limits 5 and 2
一个是实际上上限 5 和下限 2代到

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
in the answer on the earlier step or you can use Integrate,
在上一步的答案中 或者可以使用 Integrate
13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and you get back just the same result.
都能得到相同的结果

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The point is that some functions have no known closed form
关键是某些函数没有已知的闭形式

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
for their integrals.
对他们的积分而言

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Here’s an example: <i>e</i>^<i>e</i>^<i>x</i>^2 does not have an integral.
例如 <i>e</i>^<i>e</i>^<i>x</i>^2  就没有原函数

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The question is what do we do in such a case?
问题是这时候我们怎么办

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How do you find the area under the curve in such cases?
这是怎么算曲线下方的面积

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In this lesson, we’ll go over some ways
这节课 我们将介绍一些方法

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to evaluate such integrals numerically or approximately.
计算这些积分 在数值上或是近似的

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
As a first step, let’s look at so-called left and right approximations.
首先 来看一下所谓的左近似和右近似

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
When we began integration, we talked about the area of a region
当我们积分时 我们谈到了区域上的面积

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
as being a kind of Riemann sum, so you have the function value
是一种黎曼和 所以你有函数值

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
at some sample points times the length of each subinterval,
在某些采样点上的值 乘 每个子区间长度

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and then the sample points could be chosen in various ways.
然后可以通过多种方式选择采样点

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In the first case over here, if I choose <i>i</i> – 1 over here,
第一种情况下 如果我们这里选择 <i>i</i> – 1
27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
then basically I get the left-end sample points,
然后基本上就得到了 左采样点
28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
so the rectangles have their upper left-hand corners
所以这个矩形的左上角

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
lying on the curve.
在曲线上

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If you have an <i>i</i> over here,
如果你这里选 <i>i</i>

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
then you get upper-right corners lying on the curve.
那么右上角就在曲线上

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Here’s a plot to show all that.
这个图可以说明一切

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
In this first case, you have the left approximations,
第一种情况下 你有左近似

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and in the second case, you have the right approximations.
在第二个例子里 你有右近似

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It’s clear in the first case you’re kind of under approximating,
很明显 第一种情况下 你是一种下近似

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and in the second case you’re over approximating.
第二种情况下 是一种上近似

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let’s now actually work out the answers using the sum over here,
现在让我们用此处的总和来计算答案

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and you get back the answers 1.285 and 1.385.
然后得 1.285 和 1.385

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That’s the left sum.
这是左和

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That’s the right sum.
这是右和

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The actual answer is sandwiched between those two numbers.
实际答案夹在这两个数字之间

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It’s 1.3333, which is somewhere between
他是 1.3333 这就是在

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
the left and the right answers.
左右答案之间

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The question is can we do any better?
问题是我们能做的更好吗？

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, what we could do is to take
我们能做的是

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the midpoints of each subinterval as the sample point.
以每个子区间的中点作为采样点

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Here’s the midpoint in each case.
这是每个小长条的中点

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Then the rectangles have the middle of their tops
然后矩形有其顶部的中间

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
going through the curve.
都在曲线上

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Here’s a plot with our function,
这里画出我们的函数

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and you can see over here that things are better
然后你可以看到变得更好了

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
because you have some extra area over here, for example,
因为这有些额外的区域 比如这儿

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and some less area over there, so it looks like this might give you
还有一些缺了的区域补上了 所以看起来能够给你

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
a better approximation than the earlier method.
更好的近似相比先前的方法

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let’s do that, and you do find that you get a better approximation.
我们这么做 你就能得到一个更好的近似

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Another method might be to use the so-called trapezoidal rule.
另一个方法就是所谓的 梯形法

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Earlier we spoke about the left and right approximations,
之前我们谈到了左右近似

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and that’s the actual integral.
然后这是实际积分

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If you work them out, you can get back 1.285, 1.385, 1.3333.
算出来 可得 1.285 1.385 1.3333

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But what you could do is to take an average of the right and left
但是还可以取左右的平均值

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and compare it with the actual integral,
再和实际积分做比较

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and that definitely looks much better.
这看起来肯定好多了

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Effectively what you’re doing is you’re taking a trapezoid
实际上 你在做的就是用梯形

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
in each case with the height of the trapezoid equal to Δ<i>x</i>
在每个时候梯形的高等于 Δ<i>x</i>

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and the two lengths over here being
两个长度在这里

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
the lengths of the function heights at those points.
这些点处的函数高度的长度

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Here’s the answer for that trapezoidal rule,
这是梯形法的答案

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and you get back just the same result.
得到的结果是一样的

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Now to go a step further, one could actually try and use polynomials,
更进一步 实际上可以尝试使用多项式

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and that’s what is called Simpson’s rule.
这就是所谓的辛普森法

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
With Simpson’s rule, what we’ll do is use parabolas
根据辛普森法 我们要用抛物线

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
to approximate the area under the curve.
去近似曲线下面积

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But that’s a much harder problem,
但这是更难的一个问题

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
so you get back a slightly more complicated formula.
所以得到一个稍微复杂的公式

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You do need to take an even number of points,
你需要取偶数个点

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and then basically you take <i>x</i>0, <i>x</i>1, <i>x</i>2 et cetera in triples
基本上就是取 <i>x</i>0 <i>x</i>1 <i>x</i>2 等三个点

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
to compute the sum for the area.
去计算这个区域的和

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That’s a particular combination.
这是一个特别的组合

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You have 1, 4, 1 as the combination on your subinterval.
您的子区间上有 1 4 1 作为组合

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Here’s the computation with our earlier example
下面是我们前面的示例的计算

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and, let’s say, 10 subregions.
比如说 10 个子区域

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What you get back is the exact answer.
你得到的就是确切答案

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Simpson’s rule is extremely powerful.
辛普森法及其强大

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It tries to use parabolae to compute the approximation,
他用抛物线近似计算

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and in this simple case, it actually gets to the exact answer.
再简单的情况下 他实际上能得到正解

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Now whenever we do any kind of approximation,
现在 每当我们做任何近似

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
you need to worry about errors.
你需要担心误差

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
For the midpoint rule, it turns out that if you have
对于中点规则 事实证明 如果你有

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
an upper-bound <i>K</i> for the second derivative,
上界 <i>K</i> 对于二阶导数而言是存在的

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
then that’s the error for the length of <i>b</i> – <i>a</i> for the interval
那么这就是长度为 <i>b</i> – <i>a</i> 的区间上的误差

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and <i>n</i> rectangles.
关于 <i>n</i> 个矩形

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The trapezoidal rule has a very similar formula,
梯形法有一个很像的公式

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
but in fact the error is exactly twice the midpoint rule error.
但是事实上误差刚好上中点法的两倍

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Simpson’s rule is a lot better
辛普森法好多了

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
because now you look at the fourth derivative,
因为你能看到四阶导数

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and you get back an error term over here.
得到这个误差项

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Those are the maximum errors
这都是最大误差

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
for each method that we have spoken about.
对于我们提到的每一个方法而言

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The midpoint case and the trapezoidal case,
中点情形和梯形情形

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
you can work out the errors—they’re quite small—
可以让他们的误差足够小

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and compare them with the actual errors,
并且和实际误差相比较

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
namely, the difference between the actual integrals
即和实际积分的不同

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and the midpoint method and the trapezoidal method,
以及中点法和梯形法

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and you get back just the same result.
你都能得到相同的结论

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The question now is
现在的问题是

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
why did Simpson’s rule give you no error?
辛普森法的误差呢？

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The point is that you have a quadratic polynomial,
关键在于你有一个二次多项式

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
so its fourth derivative is 0,
所以他的四阶导数是 0

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and so there is no error in the Simpson’s method.
那辛普森法就没有误差

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay. Fortunately in the Wolfram Language,
好 幸运的是在 Wolfram 语言中

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
we have a wonderful function called NIntegrate
有一个好用的函数叫 NIntegrate

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
which actually computes numerical integrals very nicely.
他在实际计算数值积分时非常好

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
For the example in our introduction, <i>e</i>^<i>e</i>^<i>x</i>^2,
例如介绍中的示例 <i>e</i>^<i>e</i>^<i>x</i>^2

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
you get back a nice answer quite quickly.
很快就能得到一个很好的答案

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Here is a plot of that area.
这是面积的图像

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In general, NIntegrate uses very highly optimized methods.
通常 NIntegrate 使用更高阶的优化方法

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It does not use any particular method, but it might use
它不使用任何特定方法 但是使用

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
some very general, efficient algorithm to compute the answer.
一些非常通用 高效的算法来计算答案

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You do get back the best possible answer,
您确实会得到最好的答案

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and I strongly recommend you check your answers with NIntegrate.
我强烈建议使用 NIntegrate 检查答案

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But of course you might say oh, I really want to have
但是你当然可以说 哦 我真的很想有

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
my own function done my way to compute integrals.
我自己的函数 用自己的方式算积分

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Well, you can do that.
当然 你可以

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You can make your own functions.
你可以自己写函数

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We’ll learn that in a later lesson.
我们将在之后的课程中学习

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
For numerical integration, you can either make up your own functions
对于数值积分 可以自己的函数

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
or simply call NIntegrate.
或者简单调用 NIntegrate

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
They are both fine, but you must decide
他们俩都很好 但是你要做决定

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
how accurate you want your answer to be.
你需要多到的精度

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay. Finally, one might sometimes only have a table of values.
好的 最后 有时可能只有一张数值表
131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Here’s an example.
例如

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You’re given a table of values for the speed of a particle
有一张粒子的速度表

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
at 11 instances of time.
在 11 个时间点处

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Those are the times and the speeds,
这些是时刻和速度

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and you’ve got the trapezoidal rule.
并且有梯形法

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Basically what happens over here is you have the left endpoint
基本上这些事就是你有左端点

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and the right endpoint of the intervals,
和区间的右端点

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and then you have everything else getting counted twice.
然后你把所有的事情都算了两次

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
For Simpson’s rule, you have the left endpoint, the right endpoint
根据辛普森法 有左端点 右端点

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and then everything else getting counted four times.
然后其他所有事情都被计算了四次

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That’s the Simpson’s rule answer.
那就是辛普森法的答案

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
They are pretty close.
他们非常接近

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Here’s a plot of the data.
这是数据图

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Basically you can compute a numerical approximation
基本上可以计算出数值近似值

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
given only a table of values.
仅给出一个数值表

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
After all, all of today’s formulas depend only upon
毕竟 今天所有的公式仅取决于

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
knowing the values at a certain fixed number of points.
已知的某个固定点数的值

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That brings me to the end of this lesson,
本次课到此为止

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and the main point is that if you can’t find
要点是 如果找不到

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
the integral of a function,
函数的原函数

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
then you certainly can approximate it by various methods.
那么当然可以通过各种方法对其进行近似

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There are various techniques available.
有多种可用的技术

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You could use left or right approximations.
可以使用左或右近似

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You could use the midpoint rule,
可以使用中点法

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
the trapezoidal rule or Simpson’s rule.
梯形法 或者 辛普森法

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You could also use NIntegrate, which is a very powerful function
也可以调用 NIntegrate 这个强大的函数

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and will give you the best possible approximation
将会给你最好的近似

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
that it came up with while finding the integral.
那是我们积分是想要的

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Finally, you can use a table of values
最后 可以使用数值表

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
to compute a numerical approximation.
计算数值近似值

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That’s good enough.
够了

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
In the next lesson, we’ll go over exponential functions.
在下一课中 我们将介绍指数函数

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But before doing that, do review today’s topic.
但是在此之前 请先复习一下今天的主题

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It’s a very interesting, useful part of calculus
这是微积分中非常有趣且有用的部分

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
because very often in practice, you cannot find an exact answer.
因为在实践中 经常得不到确切的答案

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
In that case, a numerical method is the best that you have.
在这种情况下 数值方法是最好的方法

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
本节课到此为止，再见
