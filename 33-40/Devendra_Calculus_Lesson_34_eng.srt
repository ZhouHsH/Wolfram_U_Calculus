00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 34 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
您好 欢迎来到 Wolfram U 的微积分入门课程第 34 课

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The topic for this lesson is logarithmic functions.
本节课的课题是对数函数

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the subject.
我们先来简单介绍一下这个问题

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In the last lesson, we talked about exponential functions
上节课 我们讲了指数函数

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
like this one, 2^<i>x</i>.
像这个 2^<i>x</i>

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here is a plot of the function.
下面是函数的图像

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The question is suppose we want to solve the equation 2^<i>x</i> = 5.
问题是假设我们要解方程2^<i>x</i>=5

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The problem here is that 5 is not a power of 2 in any obvious way,
这里的问题是 5显然不是2的幂

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
so we give it to Solve, and then Solve comes back and tells us
所以我们把它给Solve 然后Solve回来告诉我们

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that <i>x</i> is Log[5]/Log[2].
即<i>x</i>为Log[5]/Log[2]

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That’s the answer given by Solve, and really speaking,
这是Solve给出的答案 也是真正意义上的答案

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
it’s the logarithm of 5 to the base 2.
它是以2为底5的对数

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That’s an example of a logarithm.
这就是一个对数的例子

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This lesson will talk about these logarithmic functions
本课将更详细地讨论这些对数函数

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
in more detail and some of their properties.
及其一些特性

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Basically,  a logarithm is an inverse function
基本上 对数是一个反函数

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
because it is the inverse of an exponential function <i>a</i>^<i>x</i>.
因为它是指数函数<i>a</i>^<i>x</i>的倒数

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You can think of it as having the property that
你可以认为它具有以下特性

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
<i>a</i> raised to the logarithm of <i>x</I> to the base <i>a</i> is <i>x</i>,
<i>a</i>提高到<i>x</I>的对数 以<i>a</i>为基数就是<i>x</i>

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and so is the logarithm of <i>a</i>^<i>x</i> in the base <i>a</i>.
所以是基数<i>a</i>^<i>x</i>的对数

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The number <i>a</i> is the base of the logarithm.
数字<i>a</i>是对数的底数

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now we have a function called Log in the Wolfram Language
现在我们在Wolfram语言中有一个叫做Log的函数

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
which does these calculations.
它做这些计算

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The log of 27 to the base 3 is 3 because 3^3 is 27,
以3为底27的对数是3 因为3^3是27

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and the logarithm of 1/4^–2 is –2.
而1/4^-2的对数是-2

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Keep in mind that the default base for Log is <i>e</i>,
请记住 Log的默认基数是<i>e</i>

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
so the logarithm of <i>e</i>^2 is just 2.
所以<i>e</i>^2的对数只是2

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That’s the natural logarithm which is implemented
这是在 Wolfram 语言中

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
in the Wolfram Language with base <i>e</I>.
以 <i>e</I> 为基础实现的自然对数

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Next let’s take the graph of a logarithm function.
接下来我们来看看对数函数的图形

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Here’s the graph, and you’ll notice that it’s defined
这是它的图像 你会发现它

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
only for positive <i>x</i>, and the range is all the way from –∞ up to ∞.
只对正的<i>x</i>有定义 而且范围从-∞一直到∞

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The function domain for the logarithm is just the positive numbers,
对数的函数域只是正数

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and the range is all the real numbers.
而范围都是实数

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now if you look at the limits when <i>x</I> approaches ∞,
现在如果你看看当<i>x</I>接近∞时的极限

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
then you see that the answer is ∞, and when it approaches 0,
那么你就会发现 答案是∞ 而当它接近0时

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the answer is –∞.
答案是-∞

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Of course the graph intersects the <i>x</i> axis at <i>x</i> = 1.
当然 该图与<i>x</i>轴交于<i>x</i>=1

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay. Next let’s take an example
好的接下来 我们以一个

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
where you have a base which is less than 1.
底数小于 1 的示例为例

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now the opposite happens.
现在却发生了相反的情况

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You have a function which is still defined on positive numbers,
您有一个仍在正数上定义的函数

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
but it shoots up to ∞ at 0 and goes down to –∞ on the other side.
但它在0处射到∞ 另一侧则降到-∞

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Domain and range is just the same as before,
定义域和值域和以前一样

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
but now the limits are the opposite,
但现在的极限是相反的

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
so when you approach ∞, you get –∞.
所以当你接近∞时 你会得到-∞

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
When you approach 0, you get ∞.
当你接近0时 你会得到∞

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That’s the behavior of a logarithm whose base is less than 1.
这就是底数小于1的对数的行为

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Finally, the plot has the same <i>x</i> intercept at <i>x</i> = 1.
最后 该图在<i>x</i>=1处有相同的<i>x</i>截距

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Now the point is that when you have inverse functions,
现在的问题是 当你有反函数

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
then their graphs are reflections of each other in the line <i>y</I> = <i>x</i>.
那么它们的图形在<i>y</I>=<i>x</i>这条直线上是相互反映的

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
For example, if you take E^<i>x</I> and Log[<i>x</i>],
例如 如果取E^<i>x</I>和Log[<i>x</i>]

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
then they are inverse functions, and if you look at their graphs,
那么它们就是反函数 如果你看它们的图形

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
then they are reflections of each other in the line <i>y</i> = <i>x</i>.
那么它们在线段<i>y</i>=<i>x</i>中是相互反射的

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Just the same happens if you take <i>e</I>^–<i>x</i>,
只是如果你把<i>e</I>^-<i>x</i>也是一样

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and you see that again you have a reflection,
你看 你又有了反思

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
but that’s slightly harder to see.
但这稍微有点难看

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The red plot is reflected in the line <i>y</I> = <i>x</i> to give you the blue plot.
红色图反映在线段<i>y</I>=<i>x</i>中 得到蓝色图

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Now of course there are lots of properties
当然 现在有很多属性

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
of the exponential function,
指数函数的

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and in just the same way, you have properties of the logarithm.
并且以同样的方式 你有对数的属性

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So Log[<i>x</I> * <i>y</i>] is Log[<i>x</i>] + Log[<i>y</i>].
所以Log[<i>x</I>*<i>y</i>]就是Log[<i>x</i>]+Log[<i>y</i>]

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But if you have quotients like <i>x</I>/<i>y</i>, then they turn into differences.
但如果你有像<i>x</I>/<i>y</i>这样的商 那么它们就会变成差

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Finally if you have powers, then they turn into multiplication.
最后如果你有力量 那么它们就会变成乘法

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The log of <i>x</i>^<i>b</i> is <i>b</i> times the log of <i>x</i>.
<i>x</i>^<i>b</i>的对数是<i>b</i>乘以<i>x</i>的对数

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The point is that logarithms are really useful
重点是 对数真的很有用

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
because they convert multiplication to addition,
因为它们将乘法转化为加法

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
they convert division to subtraction
他们将除法转化为减法

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and they convert powers to multiplication.
他们将幂数转化为乘法

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Now an important rule is the change of base
现在一个重要的规则是基数的变化

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
where if you have a base <i>x</i>, you can change to base <i>a</i>
如果你有一个基数<i>x</i> 你可以改成基数<i>a</i>

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
by this kind of a quotient.
由这种商

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The logarithm <i>y</i> to the base <i>x</i> is
对数<i>y</i>到基数<i>x</i>是

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
the logarithm of <i>y</i> to the base <i>a</i>
的对数 以<i>y</i>为基数<i>a</i>

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
divided by the logarithm of <i>x</i> to the base <i>a</i>.
除以<i>x</i>的对数 以<i>a</i>为基数

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay. For example, when you get back this answer from Solve,
好的例如 当你从Solve得到这个答案时

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
then that really is the logarithm of 5 to the base 2.
那就真的是5的对数到2的基数

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay. At long last, we can talk about
好了 终于 我们可以谈谈了最后 我们可以谈谈

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the derivatives and integrals of logarithms.
对数的导数和积分；

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The derivative for Log[<i>x</i>] is just 1/<i>x</i>.
Log[<i>x</i>]的导数只有1/<i>x</i>

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That’s a very nice property, very surprising.
这是一个非常好的财产 非常令人惊讶

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But the fact is that logarithms grow more slowly than polynomials.
但事实上 对数比多项式增长得更慢

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Because you have a change of base formula,
因为你的基础公式发生了变化

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
you can work out the derivative of
你可以计算出

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
the logarithm of <i>x</i> to the base <i>a</i> as 1/(<i>x</i>Log[<i>a</i>]).
<i>x</i>对基数<i>a</i>的对数为1/(<i>x</i>Log[<i>a</i>])

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You can apply the chain rule
您可以应用连锁规则

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and work out more complicated derivatives.
并计算出更复杂的衍生产品

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Here is a plot of the logarithm and its derivative.
这是一张对数及其导数的图

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Notice that the logarithm function is only defined for positive <i>x</i>
请注意 对数函数只定义了正的<i>x</i>

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
whereas its derivative is defined for all <i>x</i>,
而它的导数是对所有<i>x</i>定义的

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and that’s an issue which we’ll come back to later in the lesson.
而这个问题 我们在后面的课程中会再提到

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How about the integral of log?
那对数的积分呢？

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, the integral of log is <i>x</i>Log[<i>x</i>] – <i>x</i>,
那么 log的积分是<i>x</i>Log[<i>x</i>]-<i>x</i>

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and that’s a bit hard to prove,
而这一点很难证明

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
but you can check the answer by doing a derivative,
但你可以通过做导数来检查答案

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and you get back the usual function.
然后你就会回到通常的功能

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The integral of the natural logarithm is <i>x</i>Log[<i>x</i>] – <i>x</i>.
自然对数的积分为<i>x</i>Log[<i>x</i>]-<i>x</i>

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Here is a plot of the integral.
下面是积分图

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay. Now an important application.
好了 现在是一个重要的应用现在 一个重要的应用

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The integral of 1/<i>x</i> is possible to compute, but for that,
1/<i>x</i>的积分是可以计算的 但对于

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you need to worry about the fact that the logarithm function
你需要担心的是 对数函数

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
is only defined for positive <i>x</i> whereas 1/<i>x</i> is defined for all <i>x</i>.
只定义了正的<i>x</i> 而1/<i>x</i>定义了所有<i>x</i>

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
To work out that difficulty, what we’ll do is we’ll introduce
为了解决这个难题 我们要做的是 我们将引入

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
a logarithm of the absolute value of <i>x</i>.
<i>x</i>的绝对值的对数

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now that’s nicely defined for all numbers, except of course for 0.
现在对所有的数字都有很好的定义 当然0除外

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Once you have done that, then you can see that the integral of 1/<i>x</i>
一旦你做到了这一点 那么你可以看到1/<i>x</i>的积分

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
is the logarithm of the absolute value of <i>x</i>,
是<i>x</i>绝对值的对数

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
but in the Wolfram Language, the Log function
但在Wolfram语言中 日志函数

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
can handle both positive and negative numbers.
可以处理正数和负数

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
For example, the Log[–2] is the Log[2] plus a complex number.
例如 Log[-2]是Log[2]加上一个复数

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So in the Wolfram Language, the integral of 1/<i>x</i> is just Log[<i>x</i>].
所以在Wolfram语言中 1/<i>x</i>的积分只是Log[<i>x</i>]

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But in fact, one could write it as Log[|<i>x</i>|] + <i>C</i>.
但实际上 可以写成Log[|<i>x</i>|]+<i>C</i>

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay. Finally, let’s talk about an application.
好吧 最后 我们来谈谈应用最后 我们来谈谈应用

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Here is an exponential decay function.
这里是一个指数衰减函数

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The <i>n</i> over here is a quantity at time <i>t</i> = 0, and the question is
这边的<i>n</i>是时间<i>t</i>=0时的量 问题是

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
how long would it take for the function
需要多长时间才能完成

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
to reach half of its initial value?
以达到其初始值的一半？

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, to do that, we solve the equation and get back an answer,
好吧 要做到这一点 我们解方程 然后得到一个答案

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and this answer is called the half-life of the function.
而这个答案叫做函数的半衰期

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The λ is called the decay constant.
λ称为衰变常数

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It tells you how fast it decays.
它告诉你它的衰减速度

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
1/λ is called the mean lifetime of the function.
1/λ称为函数的平均寿命

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Often when you do such calculations,
通常当你进行这样的计算时

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
you will need to know the logarithm of 2.
你需要知道2的对数

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The numerical value is approximately 0.693,
数值约为0.693

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and that’s well worth memorizing.
这一点很值得记忆

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
With that, we come to the end of this lesson,
至此 我们来到了本节课的尾声

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the main point being that logarithms are very useful
主要是对数很有用

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
in solving exponential equations of this type.
在解这类指数方程时

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Just like you have properties of exponentials,
就像你有指数的属性一样

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
you also have properties of logarithms.
你也有对数的属性

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The derivative of a logarithm of <i>x</i> is 1/<i>x</i>.
<i>x</i>的对数的导数为1/<i>x</i>

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The integral is a lot harder.
积分的难度很大

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It is <i>x</i>Log[<i>x</i>] – <i>x</i> + <i>C</i>.
它是<i>x</i>Log[<i>x</i>]-<i>x</i>+<i>C</i>

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The integral of 1/<i>x</I> is Log[|<i>x</i>|] + <i>C</i>.
1/<i>x</I>的积分为Log[|<i>x</i>|]+<i>C</i>

136
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Of course, you can use logarithms
当然 你也可以用对数

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
to find the half-life of a function.
以求函数的半衰期

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That’s a brief introduction to logarithms—
这就是对数的简单介绍--

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
enough for us to now start talking about
足够让我们现在开始谈论

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
the so-called L’Hospital’s rule, which we’ll do next time.
所谓L'Hospital的规则 我们下次再做

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I’ll stop over here. Thank you very much.
我在这里停一下谢谢你了
