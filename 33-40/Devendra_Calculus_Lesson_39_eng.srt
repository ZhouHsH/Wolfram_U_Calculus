00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson.
让我们从本课的简单概览开始

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In this course, we have gone over lots of topics

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
are similar to what you might see on the AP Calculus AB exam,
与你在AP微积分AB考试中看到的可能很相似

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but equally well, you might see the questions on other exams

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
at an introductory calculus level.
在微积分入门水平上

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let’s begin with the first question,
先说第一个问题

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
which says find the derivative of this function over here at 2.
它说 找到这个函数的导数在2处

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There are two steps over here:
这里有两步

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
first, find the derivative,
首先 找到导数

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and secondly, plug in <i>x</i> = 2.
其次 带入<i>x</i>=2

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now to find the derivative,
首先找导数

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
what you do is you apply the quotient rule—
你要做的是应用商规则

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
after all, you have a fraction over there.
毕竟 这么大的一条分数线在那里

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The rule says that
该规则规定：

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
you find the denominator times the derivative of the numerator
找出分母乘分子的导数

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
minus numerator times derivative of the denominator
分子乘以分母的导数

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
divided by denominator squared.
除以分母平方

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then of course you plug in the value 2.
当然之后还要带入2

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That’s what I’m doing over here.
这就是我这里做的

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Then you get back the answer, and you can check the answer with D.
然后得到答案 你可以用D检查答案

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You get back just the same result.
得到的是同样的结果

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
On to question 2, which says calculate the limit
第2题 计算

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
of this function over here at 5.
这个函数这里 5的极限

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now each term in the function is continuous at 5.
现在函数中的每个项在5处连续

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The limit laws say that you can simply plug in the value 5
极限法则说 你可以简单地将数值带入5

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and work out the answer, so the answer is just 610 – 6Log[5].
并计算出答案 所以答案只有610-6Log[5]

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You can check that with Limit and you get back just the same result.
你可以用Limit检查 得到的结果也是一样的

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Here’s a plot which confirms that you actually have
这里画个图 可以证实你其实得到了

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
the limiting value at that point.

Cos[<i>x</i>]+1/<i>x</i>从π到5的积分

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Now if you apply the fundamental theorem of calculus,
现在运用微积分的基本定理

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
then you first find the antiderivative, which is Sin[<i>x</i>] + Log[<i>x</i>].
你首先要找到反导数 也就是Sin[<i>x</i>] + Log[<i>x</i>]

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You plug in the upper limit and the lower limit and you subtract,
然后带入上限和下限 然后相减

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and you get back the answer.
得到了答案

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You can confirm the answer with Integrate,
你可以用Integrate确认答案

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
which gives you just the same result.
这给你同样的结果

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Here is a plot of the region that we just integrated.
这是我们刚才积分的区域图

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
which satisfies the mean value theorem for this function.
其中满足该函数的均值定理

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What you need to do is to work out the value of <i>c</i>
您需要做的是计算出<i>c</i>的值

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
for which you get the mean value for the slope,
你可以得到斜率的平均值

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
basically, at that point <i>c</i>.
基本上 在这一点<i>c</i>上

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
First of all, you work out the slope
首先 你要计算出

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
of the line joining the endpoints.
连接两端点的线的斜率

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That’s 13.
是13

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Solve the equation—
解方程——

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
derivative of the function equal to 13 in the given range.
在给定范围内 函数的导数等于13

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You get back <i>x</i> as √(7/3).
你得到的<i>x</i>为√（7/3）

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Work out the function value.
求出函数值

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Basically you have a point
基本上你有一个

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
at which the mean value theorem is satisfied,
满足均值定理的点

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and you can check that with a plot over here.
你可以在这里用Plot函数检查

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You see that at that point,
你看 在这一点上

On to number 5, which says find the general solution
第5题 说的是找到通解

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
of this differential equation.
来满足这个微分方程

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Now that’s a separable differential equation
这是一个可分离的微分方程

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
because you can separate <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>,
因为你可以把<i>x</i>和<i>y</i>分开

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
so what you do is think of <i>y</i>' as being <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>
所以你要做的是把<i>y</i>'看作是<i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and separate the two sides, and you get back the answer,
并将两边分开 就能得到答案

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
which you can rewrite as just Exp[Log[–1 + <i>y</i>^2]] = Exp[3<i>x</i>^2 + <i>c</i>].
你可以改写为Exp[Log[-1 + <i>y</i>^2]] = Exp[3<i>x</i>^2 + <i>c</i>]

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You have a solution over here, which is <i>y</i>^2 – 1 = <i>c</i> * <i>e</i>^3<i>x</i>^2.
这里有一个解 就是<i>y</i>^2 - 1 = <i>c</i> * <i>e</i>^3<i>x</i>^2

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You can plot that solution for different values of <i>c</i>,
你可以绘制不同的<i>c</i>值的解决方案

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and here you see that there are all the different solutions.
在这里你可以看到 这里是所有的解决方案

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That’s a separable differential equation
那是一个可分离的微分方程

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
which you can solve by simple integration.
你可以通过简单的积分来解决

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Next let’s try and find the limit of this function over here at ∞.
接下来让我们试着在∞这里找到这个函数的极限

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Now at ∞, you need to only worry about
现在在∞ 你需要担心的是

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
the degrees of the numerator and denominator.
分子和分母

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Now in this case, they’re the same.
在这种情况下 他们是一样的

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
They’re both 3, so you simply need to work with those terms.
它们都是3 所以你只需要计算这些项

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The answer is going to be 10<i>x</i>^3/3<i>x</i>^3.
答案将是10<i>x</i>^3/3<i>x</i>^3

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That gives you just 10/3.
得到10/3

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You can check the answer with Limit,
你可以用Limit检查答案

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and you do get back just the same result.
得到同样的结果

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Here is a plot to visualize what’s happening,
这里有一个图像 可以直观地看到发生了什么

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and you do see that the value approaches 10/3, 3.33,
你看 值接近10/3 3.33

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
as <i>x</i> approaches ∞.
当<i>x</i>接近∞时取得

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
On to number 7, which says use the trapezoidal rule
第7题 说使用梯形规则

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
to estimate the integral over here.
来估计这里的积分

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now you are required to use five trapezoids,
要求你使用五个梯形

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
so what you do is you find the width of each trapezoid
所以你要做的是找到每个梯形的宽度

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
by doing upper limit minus lower limit over 5,
通过做上限减去下限再除以5

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
so you get back 8/5 as the width of each trapezoid.
所以你得到8/5 每个梯形的宽度

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You then work out the approximate integral
然后计算出近似积分

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
by adding the areas of these trapezoids.
通过对这些梯形的面积求和得到

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Here is the calculation, and I get back the answer 2314.03.
下面是计算结果 我得到的答案是2314.03

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Compare that with Integrate.
与Integrate相比

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It’s only somewhat close, but not very precise.
有些接近 但不很精确

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Here is a plot which shows the actual area
下面是一张图 显示了实际面积

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and the trapezoidal approximation.
和梯形近似的面积

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay. On to question 8, which says find the equation of the line
好 现在进入第8题 找到线段的方程

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
tangent to the graph of this function at (1, –2).
在(1，-2)处与这个函数的图像相切

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Now the first step, of course, is to find the slope at that point.
第一步 当然是要找到该点的斜率

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You work out the derivative, which is just <i>e</i>^(<i>x</i> – 1) – 3.
计算导数 是<i>e</i>^(<i>x</i>-1)-3

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Plug in <i>x</i> = 1 and you get back the slope as –2.
带入<i>x</i>=1 得到的斜率为-2

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You can check that with D.
可以使用D函数检查

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Basically you work out the derivative and plug in <i>x</i> = 1,
计算出导数并带入<i>x</i>=1

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and you do get back the same answer.
确实得到了同样的答案

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
By the point-slope formula, the equation on the tangent line
由点斜率公式可知 切线上的方程为

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
is going to be <i>y</i> minus <i>y</i>1 equal to slope times <i>x</i> minus <i>x</i>1.
是<i>y</i>减去<i>y</i>1等于斜率乘以<i>x</i>减去<i>x</i>1

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Here is a plot which shows that you indeed have the correct solution.
这张图可以看出你确实有解对了

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
On to number 9, which says for what value of <i>a</i>
第9题 说的是求<i>a</i>的值是多少

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
is this function over here continuous?
这个函数在这边才是连续的？

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Now this is a piecewise function.
现在这是一个极端函数

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
There are two pieces.
有两块

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
There is the part where <i>x</i> is less than 2 and the remaining part,
有<i>x</i>小于2的部分 其余部分

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and the only question is what happens at 2 itself.
而唯一的问题是函数值取2附近时会发生什么

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, for the function to be continuous, the limit from the left at 2
为了使函数连续 在2的左极限

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
should be equal to the limit from the right at 2.
应等于在2的右极限

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You solve the equation for that,
解这个方程

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
which is limit as you approach from the left
左极限

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
equal to limit from the right.
等于右极限

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Solve that for <i>a</i>, and you get back <i>a</i> as –1.
对<i>a</i>进行求解 得到<i>a</i>为-1

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If <i>a</i> is –1, then you actually have continuity.
如果<i>a</i>是-1 那么你就有连续性

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Here’s a plot which shows you that
这里的图 可以告诉你

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
you indeed have no break in the graph when <i>a</i> is –1.
当<i>a</i>为-1时 你的图形中确实没有断点

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You see over here that <i>a</i> is –1.
看这边 <i>a</i>是-1

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
On to number 10, which says find the approximate value
到了第10题 求近似值

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
of this square root to four decimal places.
这个平方根 精确到小数点后四位

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, keep in mind that the number given to you is very close to √144,
请记住 给你的这个数字是非常接近√144的

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
so that’s 12, so you need to work with the function √<i>x</i>
因此 这是12 所以你需要用函数√<i>x</i>工作

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
as the underlying function at the point (144, 12).
作为该点的基本函数（144 12）

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You first work out the slope at that point.
先计算出那个点的斜率

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Write the equation of the tangent line,
写出切线的方程

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and then use that to write the approximation,
然后用它来计算近似值

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
which is going to be 12 plus the difference over here over 24.
这将是12加上一个东西 是这个数字除以24

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let’s check how it compares with the actual value.
让我们来看看它与实际值的比较

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You see over here that you actually have
你看这里 你实际上的

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
an error which is in the tenth millions.
误差只有千万分之一

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay. Let’s go on to number 11,
好的 我们继续看第11

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
which says find the volume of the solid,
找到固体的体积

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
which you can obtain by rotating this function around the <i>y</i> axis.
这个体积可以通过围绕<i>y</i>轴旋转这个函数来获得

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Then you bound it by the <i>y</i> axis itself
然后计算在<i>y</i>轴本身

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and the line <i>x</i> = 2 and the <i>x</i> axis.
和线段<i>x</i>=2和<i>x</i>轴之间的区域

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Here’s a plot of the region.
这是一个区域的图像

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Now in this case because you’re revolving around the <i>y</i>,
现在在这种情况下 因为你是围绕着<i>y</i>旋转的

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
you use the cylindrical shell method.
应该使用柱面坐标系

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Basically you have cylinders of radii <i>x</i> and height –<i>x</i>^3 + 5<i>x</i>,
你有半径<i>x</i>和高度-<i>x</i>^3+5<i>x</i>的圆柱体

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
so that’s the integral to be computed over here.
所以这边要计算的是积分

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
There’s 2π<i>r</i> * <i>hdx</i>.
2π<i>r</i>*<i>hdx</i>

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Work it out with Integrate, and you get back the volume required.
用Integrate解决 你就能得到所需的体积

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
On to number 12, which says find the extrema of this function
第12题 要找出这个函数的极值

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
on the interval [2, 6] using the closed interval method.
在[2，6]的闭区间上

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Now because you have a polynomial, it’s in fact differentiable,
这是一个多项式 所以它是可以微分的

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
so the first step is to find the critical numbers,
所以第一步就是要找到临界点

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and those are the numbers with slope 0.
也就是是斜率为0的地方

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What you do is you find a derivative, set it equal to 0
你要做的是求导 让它等于0

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and solve in the given interval for the values of <i>x</i>.
并在给定区间内求解<i>x</i>的值

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We just find one value, <i>x</i> is 3, so you must check at 2, at 3 and at 6.
我们只找到了一个值 <i>x</i>是3 所以在2处、3处和6处进行检查

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Here’s the function.
这个函数

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Work out the value at those three points, and you see now that
我们计算出这三点的值 你看到的是

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
you have a maximum over here and a minimum over there,
这里是最大值 这里是最小值

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
so you have a maximum at (3, –9) and a minimum at (6, –108).
所以你的最大值在（3，-9） 最小值在（6，-108）

165
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can check that with a plot.
你可以用Plot函数来检查

166
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You can see you have a maximum at 3 and a minimum at 6.
你可以看到最高点是3 最低点是6

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
On to number 13, which says find the derivative
第13题 它说要找到这里这个函数的导数

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
of this function over here.
第13题 它说要找到这里这个函数的导数

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Now the function has two terms, so for the first term,
现在函数有两项 所以对于第一项

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you use the product rule, and you get back the first term
你使用乘法规则 你得到 第一个项

171
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
times derivative of second term
乘以第二项的导数

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
plus second term times derivative of first.
加上第二项乘以第一项的导数

173
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Then you work out the second-term derivative in the same way.
用同样的方法计算出第二项的导数

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Get the answer, and then by the difference rule for derivatives,
得到答案 再由差法则求导数

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you simply subtract them like over here to get back the final result.
只需像这里一样减去它们 就能得到最终结果

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You can check that with D,
你可以用D函数检查

177
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and you see that it does just the same thing.
你看 答案确实如此

178
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That brings me to the end of the first part
第一部分的微积分考试样本就到此结束了

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
of the sample calculus exam.
第一部分的微积分考试样本就到此结束了

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Do review it.
记得复习

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
These are not very difficult questions.
这些都不是很困难的问题

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The next part will have some more challenging questions,
下一部分会有一些更具挑战性的问题

183
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
but by then,
到那时

184
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I hope you’ll be ready to take up those more difficult questions.
我希望你能准备好接受那些更难的问题

185
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
