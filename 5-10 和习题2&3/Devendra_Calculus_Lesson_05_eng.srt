00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 5 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Our topic for today is the laws of limits. Let’s begin with a brief overview

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
of today’s lesson. We learned in the previous lesson that using tables to find limits

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
can be very tedious work. What we’ll do today is to set up some laws for limits

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which will let us compute the same limits quite easily. To do that,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I’m going to use two example functions. The first one is called <i>f</i>. The second one is called <i>g</i>.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
<i>f</i> is 2<i>x</i> + 2, and <i>g</i> is 3Cos[<i>x</i>]/2. Those two functions are gonna serve as

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
our example functions in the first part of the lesson. Here are the plots of the functions.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
<i>f</i> is of course just a linear function, while <i>g</i> is a trigonometric function. Now if you look at the plots,

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
it’s clear that the limit of <i>f</i> is going to be 2 at 0, and the limit of <i>g</i> is going to be 3/2.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let’s confirm that with the Limit function. The limits are 2 and 3/2. You need to bear in mind

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
throughout today that <i>f</i> is this linear function, <i>g</i> is a trigonometric function

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and the limits are 2 and 3/2. With just that small piece of baggage,

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
we can now begin our discussion of the laws of limits, and the first law called the sum law.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It says that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits. For example, if you want to find

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
of <i>f</i> + <i>g</i>, you simply add 2 and 3/2 and get 7/2, and you can check that with the Limit function

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and get back just the same result. Here’s a plot of all three functions, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i> and <i>f</i> + <i>g</i>,

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and you can see quite clearly that <i>f</i> + <i>g</i>, which is right over here, has got the limit 7/2

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
as <i>x</i> approaches 0. Now along with that, you can also say that the limit of a difference

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
is going to be the difference of the limits. In our case, it’s going to be 2 − 3/2. That’s 1/2.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You also have a scalar multiplication law, which let you multiply a constant by a function,

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and then you simply do the limit of the function times that constant. If you want to find

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the limit of 3 * <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], it’s just going to be 3 times the limit of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], so that’s 3 * 2 is 6, in this case.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You’ve got the sum law, the difference law and the scalar multiplication law so far,

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and to go on, let’s talk now about the product law, which says that the limit of a product

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
is the product of the limits. For example, if you want to find the limit of <i>f</I>  *<i>g</i>,

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
it’s just going to be 2 * 3/2. That’s 3. You can check that with Limit and get back

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
just the same answer. Here’s a plot of all the three functions—<i>f</i>, <i>g</i> and <i>f</i> * g</i>—

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and you can see quite clearly that the limit of <i>f</i> * <i>g</i> is 3, exactly as we said earlier on.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Along with the product law, we also have the power law, which says that if you want to find

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the limit for a power, then it is the power of the limit. For example, the limit of <i>f</i>^3

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
is the cube of the limit of <i>f</i>, so 2^3 is 8, and therefore you get back 8 as the answer.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now you’ve got the sum law, the difference law, the scalar multiplication law,

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the product law and the power law. As the next law for us, we take up the quotient law.

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
When you divide things can go wrong, but most of the time they don’t. The limit of a quotient is

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
the quotient of the limits, provided that the denominator does not have a limit of 0.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In our case, <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>, you have the limit of <i>f</i>/<i>g</i> is just 4/3 because 2/(3/2) is 4/3.

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Here is a plot of all the three functions, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i> and <i>f</i>/<i>g</i>. You can again see what is happening

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that the answer is actually correct as guessed by us. There is a problem at π/2, though,

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
because the value of <i>g</i> at π/2 is 0. Then we are in trouble because the limit of <i>f</i>/<i>g</i>

41
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,000
at that point is just indeterminate. The quotient law is almost true, and it’s not true

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
when the denominator is becoming 0 in any way.

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay. Some examples now of limits. If you have a polynomial, then you can quite easily

44
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
compute its limit, but to do that we need to access some facts. First of all, fact 1:

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the limit of a constant is a constant. Let’s check that. The limit of 5 will be 5,

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and the limit of 1/2 would be 1/2, et cetera. The limit of a constant is a constant,

47
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and the other fact is that the limit of the simple function <i>x</i> as <i>x</i> approaches <i>a</i> is just <i>a</i>.

48
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You just plug in <i>a</i> and get back the answer. Okay. Once you have just those two facts,

49
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
then you can work out the limit of any polynomial. For example, if you want to work out

50
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
the limit of 2<i>x</i>^2 − 4<i>x</i> + 3, you simply plug in the values over there, and you get back

51
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
the answer at 4, for example.

52
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay. We now worked out the limit of a polynomial by substitution, and the question is

53
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
what happens when you have a rational function?

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Here is a rational function, and you want to find the limit of this function when <i>x</i> approaches −2.

55
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Now when <i>x</i> is −2, there is no problem at all because the denominator is not 0.

56
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Here you have <i>g</i> is the numerator, <i>h</i> is the denominator of the rational function, and to find

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
the limit of <i>f</i> as <i>x</i> approaches −2, you simply divide the limits of numerator and denominator,

58
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and you get back the answer 10/13 whether you work out the limit directly or you work it out

59
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
by taking a quotient, like over here, or you simply work out a value of the function at −2.

60
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Rational functions are almost as easy as polynomials in most cases. But to go on,

61
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I’ll give an example where things can go wrong. Here’s an example of a rational function,

62
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
but you want to find the limit at −1, and sure enough, there’s an issue over here

63
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
because the denominator becomes 0. The denominator is 0 over here;

64
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
we cannot use a direct computation, so what we do is we factor the numerator

65
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and check that, in fact, we have a common factor of 1 + <i>x</i>. To cancel this common factor,

66
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
we can use several functions. I’ll use Simplify over here, and that’ll get the function down to

67
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
its simplest possible form in which you can plug in the values, and you can see quite clearly

68
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
that the limit is −1 − 1. That’s −2, and that’s confirmed by the Limit function.

69
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay. That’s about rational functions, and now to go a step further, let’s talk about difference quotients,

70
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
which are very closely related to all the previous ideas. Here is the difference quotient for

71
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
a rational function, and what you see over here is if you plot it, then it’s just a straight line.

72
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What’s happening? Well, what’s happening is that although the <i>h</i> over here is 0 at <i>h</i> = 0,

73
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
there is a common factor, and to find the common factor, you can do an expansion

74
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and then do a kind of factoring and get the function down to its simplest possible form.

75
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That function over there <i>f</i>, which looked difficult, is in fact just 4 + <i>h</i>.

76
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Then what you can do is you can work out the limit of <i>f</i> as <i>h</i> approaches 0 and get the answer as 4.

77
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We have learned now that sometimes canceling factors is a really good idea.

78
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay. Next, how about things like the absolute value function? Here’s the absolute value function.

79
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:29,000
If I plot it, it’s kind of got a V shape, and when you are at 0 over here, then it’s clear that the limit is 0

80
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
whether you approach from the left or the right. The left-hand limit and the right-hand limit

81
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
are both 0 from this picture. You can confirm that with Limit itself by doing a direction computation.

82
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You get back 0 and 0 whether you go from the left or right, and Limit itself also gives 0,

83
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
so there’s no problem over here. Although you do have kind of a piecewise function,

84
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
it in fact has a very simple limit at 0.

85
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
On the other hand, here’s an example where things can go wrong. If you divide

86
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the real absolute value of <i>x</i> by <i>x</i>, then the plot shows that you clearly have a kind of jump over here

87
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
because when you are at the right, the answer is 1, and when you are at the left the answer is −1.

88
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The left-hand limit is −1, the right-hand limit is 1, and hence the limit does not exist.

89
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That’s a jump at a single point, but of course things can get much worse.

90
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Here is the so-called floor function. The floor function will calculate the greatest integer

91
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
less than or equal to <i>x</i>. The problem is to find where the limit does not exist

92
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:04,000
in the range from −2 to 2. Here’s a plot, and it’s clear that you have an issue at all the integers.

93
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:13,000
They jump at every place. For example, at 0 you have the left-hand limit is −1

94
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and the right-hand limit is 0, so the limit does not exist. In fact, I can confirm that

95
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:30,000
at every integer between −2 and 2, you have no limit existing. All the limits are indeterminate.

96
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The floor function is an example of a function which has no limit at an infinite number of points.

97
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Now in practice, if we have a very complicated function like the one over here,

98
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
then what you can try and do is to kind of squeeze the function between two simpler functions.

99
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
A little more abstractly, if you have a function <i>g</i> and that function <i>g</i> lies between <i>f</i> and <i>h</i>

100
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and you know the limits of both <i>f</i> and <i>h</i>, then you also know the limit of <i>g</i>.

101
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
With the function over here, you can see quite clearly that the cosine is going to go

102
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
between −1 and 1, so you could pick <i>f</i> to be <i>x</i>^2 and pick <i>h</i> to be −<i>x</i>^2.

103
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That’s going between −1 and 1. You’ve got <i>f</i>, you’ve got <i>g</i> and you’ve got <i>h</i>. <i>g</i> is the complicated one,

104
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and if you plot them, you see that <i>g</i> is tightly squeezed between <i>f</i> and <i>h</i> near 0.

105
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
<i>g</i> is this wiggly function over here, and it’s very tightly squeezed. The squeeze theorem says that

106
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
you can work out the limit of <i>g</i> provided that you can find the limits of <i>f</i> and <i>h</i>.

107
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But <i>f</i> and <i>h</i> are simple. They’re polynomials, so their limits are just 0,

108
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and hence the limit of <i>g</i> is 0 as well.

109
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of today’s lesson, and I’ll summarize by saying that

110
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
the limit laws give us a way to find the limits of functions mathematically.

111
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You can use tables for sure, but the limit laws are the best ways to get the limits of functions.

112
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:36,000
There are laws for sums, for differences, for products and for quotients. Now from these laws,

113
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
you can work out the law of finding limits for any polynomial. That’s really simple,

114
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
but it is somewhat harder to find the limits of rational functions which can become 0

115
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
in the denominator at some point or piecewise functions where things can go quite wrong, et cetera.

116
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Finally, the squeeze theorem is a great way to find limits when you are given difficult functions

117
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
which can be squeezed between simpler functions. This is about today’s lesson,

118
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and the next lesson, we’ll cover continuous functions, which will make life much easier for us

119
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
as far as finding limits are concerned. But before that, we will have a problem session

120
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,000
to discuss various problems which relate to the material covered so far. Do review today’s lesson,

121
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
go over the examples, the exercises and try and figure out how you might proceed

122
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
by trying things on your own and mastering the area. Thank you very much. I’ll stop here.
