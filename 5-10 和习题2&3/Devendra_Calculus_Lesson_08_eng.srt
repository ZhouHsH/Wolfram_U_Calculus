00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 8 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Our topic for today is the derivative as a function.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of today’s lesson. In Lesson 7, you learned about

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
finding the derivatives at particular points for a function. Now the fact is that

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
you can go beyond that and the derivative itself can be regarded as a function.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Starting with a function, you can find the derivative, and then that gives you another function.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The way to do that in the Wolfram Language is to use to the function D. Let’s say you have

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
a function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] like over here. You can work out the derivative using D, and you get back

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
another function. Now you can plot the function and the derivative on the same plot,

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and you get back this picture of the function in blue and its derivative in orange.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The point over here is that the derivative is a function just like the earlier one,

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and you can keep on doing the same process, and that’s the plan for today, to talk about

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
derivatives as functions and higher derivatives.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay. A simple example. Let’s say I ask you to find the derivative of <i>x</i>^3 + <i>x</i>.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You can work out the derivatives in D—that’s 3<i>x</i>^2 + 1—and then you can also use <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>].

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
that’s another way to do the same thing. You can plot the function derivative

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and you get back the result, which is the plot for both these functions. Now the difficulty is that

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
there are many ways to write derivatives. Let’s talk a little bit about derivative notation.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Some people prefer to write <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] for the function then <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>] for the derivative. Others prefer D.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Some prefer <i>y</i>’, some use <i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>, some use <i>df</i>/<i>dx</i>, et cetera. In fact, mathematicians like

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
to think of D and <i>d</i>/<i>dx</i> as being as being differentiation operators which work on functions

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and give you their derivatives. The whole process of calculating derivatives is called differentiation.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
There is a lot of terminology over here, but as far as we are concerned, if you know D and <i>f</i>',

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
that’s good enough for you. So here I’ve got D[<i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]] and <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>], and you get back

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
just the same result in both the cases. For this lesson, if you know D and <i>f</i>',

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
that’s enough to do all the calculations.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay. One issue with derivatives is that they are defined by limits. If they are limits,

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and because you can talk about left-hand and right-hand limits, you can also talk about

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
left-hand and right-hand derivatives at a point. Here’s a function <i>g</i>

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
defined using the RealAbs function, the absolute value function, and clearly there will be

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
an issue at 5 where the sign changes. If you find the derivatives from the right and left at 5,

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
then what you see is that they are different, so you have a problem

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
because the left-hand and right-hand derivatives at the point 5 do not agree.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you plot the function derivative, you see a little more clearly. That’s the original function,

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and the derivative is 3 on the right and −3 on the left. That’s one way in which things can go wrong,

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
namely that the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit do not agree,

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and you do not have a derivative at that point.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let’s talk about differentiability. A function is differentiable if <i>f</i>'[<i>a</i>] exists for a point <i>a</i>,

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and of course if you were to have a whole range of values from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, then it’s differentiable

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
if it’s differentiable at every point, every number in that interval. Here’s a function.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let’s find the derivative. The question is where is it differentiable? Well, the only difficulty

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
would be at 0 because then you have a 0 in the denominator over here, and in fact,

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
if you work out the left- and right-hand derivatives at this point at 0, then you do see

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that they are very different. In fact if you plug in 0 into <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>], you get back an indeterminate answer.

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Here’s a function which we just showed you which is differentiable everywhere except at 0.

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The question arises in what way can a function be non-differentiable? When can things go wrong?

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
One way that they can go wrong is if you’re at a corner. Here’s an example.

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You have the absolute value function times 3, and if you plot it with the derivative, you see that at 0

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
the calculation and graph both show that you have a problem at 0. You have a corner over there

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
which leads to the differentiability being lost. Here’s a corner for the function,

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and that’s an issue for differentiability. Another thing that can go wrong is that you are at a cusp.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Here’s a cube root function, and at 0 again the problem is because you actually have a cusp.

53
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That’s a cusp over there, a change in shape, and that’s going to cause you problems with derivatives.

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You can see the derivative does not exist at 0.

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
A third way in which things can go wrong is if you are at a discontinuity of a function.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Here’s a function. It’s piecewise, and it changes form at 0. That’s the function.

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Work out the derivative, and its 0 is a problem. You get indeterminate. If you plot it,

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
you can see quite clearly that everything’s fine everywhere except at 0.

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,000
One last thing that can go wrong is if you are at a vertical tangent. Here’s the cube root function again,

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and if we look at 0, you actually have a problem because you have a vertical tangent over there.

61
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That’s the way in which things can go wrong, but for the most part, functions will be differentiable,

62
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and if they are not, it will only happen at a few isolated points.

63
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Now starting with a function, you cannot just work out the first derivative like over here,

64
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
but you can go a step further and work out the second derivative. The second derivative is

65
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:59,000
the derivative of the first derivative. We with start with 4<i>x</i>^3. You get 12<i>x</i>^2 and then you get 24<i>x</i>,

66
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and you can get the same result by using D with this notation, which says differentiate <i>f</i>

67
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
with respect to <i>x</i> two times, and you get back just the same answer. That’s the shorthand

68
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:23,000
for computing the second derivative. Here are the plots of all three. There’s <i>f</i>, there’s the first derivative

69
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and the second derivative. The point is starting from a function, you can work out the derivative.

70
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Then you can work its derivative, and they are all just as good as functions.

71
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now of course you can go on with that, and in the Wolfram Language you can work out the <i>n</i>th derivative

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
for any value of <i>n</i>, whether it be 1 or 2 or 6 or 100 or whatever. Here’s a simple function <i>x</i>^6.

73
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You can work out the first six derivatives. The first expression over here is just the function itself,

74
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and the last one is 720, which means that you are almost at the edge

75
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
where things are going to start becoming 0. Okay. Here’s a plot of the first six derivatives.

76
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You have the function over here, first derivative, second derivative, et cetera.

77
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You can see over here that the <i>n</i>th derivative is a function just like the earlier one.

78
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay. Now in physics, there are some special names for <i>n</i>th derivatives.

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Here’s a position function <i>s</i>[<i>t</i>], and if you work out the first six derivatives, they’ve got names.

80
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They’re called the velocity, the acceleration, the jerk, snap, crackle, pop.

81
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That’s first derivative, second derivative, third derivative, fourth, fifth and sixth.

82
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If you plot them, then just like in the earlier case you get back a plot, but now this shows you

83
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
the variation of the position and velocity, et cetera as time goes by.

84
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
High derivatives are really quite useful. They occur in physics, they occur elsewhere

85
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and in fact they are what makes calculus so applicable in real life.

86
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay. Now we’re at the end of today’s lesson, and what you’ve learned is that you can

87
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
work out derivatives not just at points, but for entire functions, and what you get then is

88
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
a new function. Because a derivative is a limit, you can compute left and right derivatives.

89
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Now if it happens that the left and right derivatives are not equal, then the derivative

90
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
does not exist at the given point. If it does exist, then the function is differentiable at that point.

91
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You’ve got differentiable functions and non-differentiable functions which can occur in many ways,

92
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
like you are at a corner, you are at a cusp, et cetera. As I said earlier on,

93
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
most functions will be differentiable almost everywhere. Now you can go a step further from derivatives

94
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and work out higher-order derivatives—the first, second, third, fourth, et cetera—

95
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and those are quite useful. For example, they’re useful for studying the motion of a particle.

96
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That’s a lot of stuff over here. We talked about higher derivatives, left derivatives, right derivatives.

97
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That’s a whole bag of ideas, and in the next lesson we’ll try and make things look much simpler

98
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
by talking about the rules for finding derivatives. It might all look a little bit difficult right now,

99
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
but once you have rules of derivatives, then things will become much simpler.

100
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That’s for Lesson 9, but before that we will have Problem Session 2 and you can take a small quiz,

101
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and that should put you in good shape for Lesson 9. But I’ll stop over here for Lesson 8.

102
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I hope you have enjoyed it. Thank you.
