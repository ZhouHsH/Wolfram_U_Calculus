00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 5 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
你好 欢迎来到 Wolfram U 微积分入门的第五课 

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Our topic for today is the laws of limits. Let’s begin with a brief overview
我们今天的主题是极限定律 让我们从一个简短的课程概述开始 

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
of today’s lesson. We learned in the previous lesson that using tables to find limits
在之前的课程中 我们学习了利用表格来计算极限 

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
can be very tedious work. What we’ll do today is to set up some laws for limits
这是十分乏味的工作 今天我们将建立一些关于极限的法则

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which will let us compute the same limits quite easily. To do that,
这些法则会使极限的计算变得十分简单 为了做到这一点 

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I’m going to use two example functions. The first one is called <i>f</i>. The second one is called <i>g</i>.
我会使用两个函数作为例子 第一个函数命名为 <i>f</i> 第二个命名为 <i>g</i> 

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
<i>f</i> is 2<i>x</i> + 2, and <i>g</i> is 3Cos[<i>x</i>]/2. Those two functions are gonna serve as
<i>f</i> = 2<i>x</i> + 2 <i>g</i> = 3Cos[<i>x</i>]/2 这两个函数会在 

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
our example functions in the first part of the lesson. Here are the plots of the functions.
课程的第一部分作为我们的示例函数 这是函数的图像 

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
<i>f</i> is of course just a linear function, while <i>g</i> is a trigonometric function. Now if you look at the plots,
显然 <i>f</i> 是一个线性函数 而 <i>g</i> 是一个三角函数 如果观察一下这些图像 

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
it’s clear that the limit of <i>f</i> is going to be 2 at 0, and the limit of <i>g</i> is going to be 3/2.
就会发现 <i>f</i> 在 0 处的极限为 2 <i>g</i> 在 0 处的极限为 3/2 

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let’s confirm that with the Limit function. The limits are 2 and 3/2. You need to bear in mind
让我们用 Limit 函数确认一下 极限是 2 和 3/2 你需要记住 
 
12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
throughout today that <i>f</i> is this linear function, <i>g</i> is a trigonometric function
今天课程中的 <i>f</i> 代表这个线性函数 而 <i>g</i> 代表一个三角函数 

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and the limits are 2 and 3/2. With just that small piece of baggage,
并且它们的极限分别是 2 和 3/2 只要记住这一点 

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
we can now begin our discussion of the laws of limits, and the first law called the sum law.
我们就可以开始关于极限法则的讨论 第一个法则是极限的加法法则

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It says that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits. For example, if you want to find
即 函数和的极限等于函数极限的和 举个例子 如果你想求 

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
of <i>f</i> + <i>g</i>, you simply add 2 and 3/2 and get 7/2, and you can check that with the Limit function
<i>f</i> + <i>g</i> 的极限 只需要简单的把 2 和 3/2 相加得到 7/2 你可以用 Limit 函数检查一下 

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and get back just the same result. Here’s a plot of all three functions, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i> and <i>f</i> + <i>g</i>,
会得到相同的结果 这是三个函数 <i>f</i> <i>g</i> 和 <i>f</i> + <i>g</i> 的图像 

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and you can see quite clearly that <i>f</i> + <i>g</i>, which is right over here, has got the limit 7/2
可以十分清楚地看到 <i>f</i> + <i>g</i> 就在这儿 当 <i>x</i> 趋于 0 时 

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
as <i>x</i> approaches 0. Now along with that, you can also say that the limit of a difference
取得极限值 7/2 你也可以说 函数差的极限 

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
is going to be the difference of the limits. In our case, it’s going to be 2 − 3/2. That’s 1/2.
等于函数极限的差 在我们的例子中 函数极限的差为 2 − 3/2 即 1/2 

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You also have a scalar multiplication law, which let you multiply a constant by a function,
还有数乘法则 当你想求常数与一个函数乘积的极限 

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and then you simply do the limit of the function times that constant. If you want to find
只需要简单地把函数的极限与该常数相乘 例如想算

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the limit of 3 * <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], it’s just going to be 3 times the limit of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], so that’s 3 * 2 is 6, in this case.
3 * <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 的极限 只需用 3 乘 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 的极限 那么就是 3 * 2 等于 6 在这个例子里 

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You’ve got the sum law, the difference law and the scalar multiplication law so far,
目前为止你已经有了极限的加法法则 减法法则和数乘法则

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and to go on, let’s talk now about the product law, which says that the limit of a product
继续 让我们来讨论一下乘法法则 该定律表述为 函数乘积的极限 

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
is the product of the limits. For example, if you want to find the limit of <i>f</I>  *<i>g</i>,
等于函数极限的乘积 举个例子 如果想求 <i>f</I>  *<i>g</i> 的极限 

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
it’s just going to be 2 * 3/2. That’s 3. You can check that with Limit and get back
只需把 2 与 3/2 相乘 得 3 你可以用 Limit 检查一下 结果

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
just the same answer. Here’s a plot of all the three functions—<i>f</i>, <i>g</i> and <i>f</i> * g</i>—
是相同的 这是三个函数 <i>f</i>, <i>g</i> and <i>f</i> * g</i> 的图像 

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and you can see quite clearly that the limit of <i>f</i> * <i>g</i> is 3, exactly as we said earlier on.
十分清晰地可以看出 <i>f</i> * <i>g</i> 的极限是 3 确实如我们之前所言 

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Along with the product law, we also have the power law, which says that if you want to find
除了乘法法则 我们还有极限的幂法则 表述为 函数幂的极限 

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the limit for a power, then it is the power of the limit. For example, the limit of <i>f</i>^3
等于函数极限的幂 例如 <i>f</i>^3 的极限 

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
is the cube of the limit of <i>f</i>, so 2^3 is 8, and therefore you get back 8 as the answer.
是 <i>f</i> 极限的立方 也就是 2^3 等于 8 因此 8 就是答案 

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now you’ve got the sum law, the difference law, the scalar multiplication law,
现在你已经获得了加法法则 减法法则 数乘法则 

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the product law and the power law. As the next law for us, we take up the quotient law.
乘法法则以及幂法则 下一个法则是商法则 

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
When you divide things can go wrong, but most of the time they don’t. The limit of a quotient is
当你做除法的时时可能会出错 但大多数时候不会出错 函数商的极限等于 

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
the quotient of the limits, provided that the denominator does not have a limit of 0.
函数极限的商 条件是分母的极限不为零 

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In our case, <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>, you have the limit of <i>f</i>/<i>g</i> is just 4/3 because 2/(3/2) is 4/3.
我么的例子里 <i>f</i>/<i>g</i> 的极限就是 4/3 因为 2/(3/2) 是 4/3 

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Here is a plot of all the three functions, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i> and <i>f</i>/<i>g</i>. You can again see what is happening
这是三个函数  <i>f</i> <i>g</i> 和 <i>f</i>/<i>g</i> 的图像 你可以再次看到

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that the answer is actually correct as guessed by us. There is a problem at π/2, though,
答案与我们的猜测一致 不过在 π/2 处出现了问题 

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
because the value of <i>g</i> at π/2 is 0. Then we are in trouble because the limit of <i>f</i>/<i>g</i>
这是因为 <i>g</i> 在  π/2 的值是 0 于是我们有了麻烦 因为 <i>f</i>/<i>g</i> 的极限 

41
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,000
at that point is just indeterminate. The quotient law is almost true, and it’s not true
在这一点是不确定的 商法则在大多数情况是正确的 但是 

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
when the denominator is becoming 0 in any way.
当作为分母的函数极限为 0 时商法则就不再正确了 

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay. Some examples now of limits. If you have a polynomial, then you can quite easily
好吧 现在来看一些极限的例子 如果有一个多项式 那么可以很容易地 

44
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
compute its limit, but to do that we need to access some facts. First of all, fact 1:
计算它的极限 但要做到这一点 我们需要了解一些事实 首先是事实 1： 

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the limit of a constant is a constant. Let’s check that. The limit of 5 will be 5,
常数的极限是一个常数 让我们来检验一下 5 的极限是 5 

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and the limit of 1/2 would be 1/2, et cetera. The limit of a constant is a constant,
1/2 的极限是 1/2 等等 常数的极限是常数 

47
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and the other fact is that the limit of the simple function <i>x</i> as <i>x</i> approaches <i>a</i> is just <i>a</i>.
第二个事实是 简单函数 <i>x</i> 在自变量 <i>x</i> 趋近于 <i>a</i> 时的值为 <i>a</i> 

48
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You just plug in <i>a</i> and get back the answer. Okay. Once you have just those two facts,
只需要取函数值 <i>a</i> 作为极限值即可 好 一旦你有了这两个事实 

49
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
then you can work out the limit of any polynomial. For example, if you want to work out
就可以计算多项式的极限 例如 你想算

50
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
the limit of 2<i>x</i>^2 − 4<i>x</i> + 3, you simply plug in the values over there, and you get back
2<i>x</i>^2 − 4<i>x</i> + 3 在某一点的极限 只需简单的取多项式在那一点的值 就会得到 

51
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
the answer at 4, for example.
在自变量取 4 时的极限 

52
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay. We now worked out the limit of a polynomial by substitution, and the question is
好了 我们通过代换得到了多项式的极限 问题是

53
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
what happens when you have a rational function?
当你遇到有理函数的时候呢?

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Here is a rational function, and you want to find the limit of this function when <i>x</i> approaches −2.
这是有一个有理函数 并且你想算自变量 <i>x</i> 趋近于 -2 时的函数极限 

55
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Now when <i>x</i> is −2, there is no problem at all because the denominator is not 0.
现在 <i>x</i> 取值为 -2 这完全没有问题因为有理函数的分母不为 0 

56
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Here you have <i>g</i> is the numerator, <i>h</i> is the denominator of the rational function, and to find
这里 <i>g</i> 是有理函数的分子 <i>h</i> 是分母 为了 

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
the limit of <i>f</i> as <i>x</i> approaches −2, you simply divide the limits of numerator and denominator,
为了得到当 <i>x</i> 趋近于 -2 时 <i>f</i> 的极限值 可以简单地用分子的极限除以分母的极限 

58
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and you get back the answer 10/13 whether you work out the limit directly or you work it out
得到的答案是 10/13 无论你直接计算极限 还是通过 

59
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
by taking a quotient, like over here, or you simply work out a value of the function at −2.
取分子分母极限的商计算极限 或者直接取函数在 -2 处的值 

60
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Rational functions are almost as easy as polynomials in most cases. But to go on,
有理函数在大多数情况下几乎像多项式函数一样简单 不过接下来

61
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I’ll give an example where things can go wrong. Here’s an example of a rational function,
我会给出一个出错的例子 这是一个有关有理函数的例子 

62
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
but you want to find the limit at −1, and sure enough, there’s an issue over here
不过这次你想求函数在 -1 点的极限值 十分确定的是 这里是有问题的 

63
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
because the denominator becomes 0. The denominator is 0 over here;
因为分母为 0 由于分母为 0 

64
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
we cannot use a direct computation, so what we do is we factor the numerator
我们无法直接计算 所以我们将分子因式分解 

65
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and check that, in fact, we have a common factor of 1 + <i>x</i>. To cancel this common factor,
观察一下 事实上 我们有公因式 1 + <i>x</i> 消去公因子

66
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
we can use several functions. I’ll use Simplify over here, and that’ll get the function down to
我们可以调用多种函数 这里我用 Simplify 简化一下 得到函数的 

67
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
its simplest possible form in which you can plug in the values, and you can see quite clearly
可能的最简形式 你可以直接使用这种形式取值 且十分清楚地看到 

68
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
that the limit is −1 − 1. That’s −2, and that’s confirmed by the Limit function.
函数极限值为 −1 − 1 也就是 − 2 这是由极限函数证明的 

69
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay. That’s about rational functions, and now to go a step further, let’s talk about difference quotients,
好 这是关于有理函数的 现在更进一步 讨论一下差商 

70
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
which are very closely related to all the previous ideas. Here is the difference quotient for
这与之前的想法非常接近 这是一个有理函数的差商 

71
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
a rational function, and what you see over here is if you plot it, then it’s just a straight line.
你可以看到 如果将这个差商画出来 就是一条直线 

72
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What’s happening? Well, what’s happening is that although the <i>h</i> over here is 0 at <i>h</i> = 0,
发生了什么? 尽管分母在 <i>h</i> = 0 处的值为 0 

73
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
there is a common factor, and to find the common factor, you can do an expansion
然而分子分母有公因子 为了找到这个公因子 你可以将其展开 

74
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and then do a kind of factoring and get the function down to its simplest possible form.
然后分解因式将函数化为最简形式 

75
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That function over there <i>f</i>, which looked difficult, is in fact just 4 + <i>h</i>.
所以这个函数 <i>f</i> 看起来很复杂 实际上就是 4 + <i>h</i> 

76
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Then what you can do is you can work out the limit of <i>f</i> as <i>h</i> approaches 0 and get the answer as 4.
然后 你需要做的就是计算 <i>h</i> 趋于 0 时函数 <i>f</i> 的极限 答案是 4 

77
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We have learned now that sometimes canceling factors is a really good idea.
我们认识到有时消去因式是一个很好的主意 

78
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay. Next, how about things like the absolute value function? Here’s the absolute value function.
好 下一步 如果是绝对值函数的情况呢? 这是一个绝对值函数 

79
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:29,000
If I plot it, it’s kind of got a V shape, and when you are at 0 over here, then it’s clear that the limit is 0
如果我把它画出来 它是 V 形的 并且函数值在 0 处显然为 0 

80
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
whether you approach from the left or the right. The left-hand limit and the right-hand limit
无论你从左侧还是右侧趋近 都会得到相同的结果 左极限和右极限 

81
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
are both 0 from this picture. You can confirm that with Limit itself by doing a direction computation.
可以从图中看出都是 0 你可以直接计算证明这个极限 

82
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You get back 0 and 0 whether you go from the left or right, and Limit itself also gives 0,
无论从左侧还是从右侧你都会得到 0 所以极限本身即为 0 

83
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
so there’s no problem over here. Although you do have kind of a piecewise function,
所以 这里没有问题 尽管这是一类分段函数 

84
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
it in fact has a very simple limit at 0.
事实上它在 0 点具有一个十分简单的极限 

85
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
On the other hand, here’s an example where things can go wrong. If you divide
另一方面 这里有一个错误的例子 如果你 

86
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the real absolute value of <i>x</i> by <i>x</i>, then the plot shows that you clearly have a kind of jump over here
如果你将 <i>x</i> 的绝对值函数除以 <i>x</i> 那么图像将会有明显的跳跃 

87
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
because when you are at the right, the answer is 1, and when you are at the left the answer is −1.
因为你的右极限为 1 而左极限为 -1 

88
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The left-hand limit is −1, the right-hand limit is 1, and hence the limit does not exist.
左右极限不相等 因此极限并不存在 

89
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That’s a jump at a single point, but of course things can get much worse.
函数在单点发生跳跃 然而情况可以变得更糟 

90
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Here is the so-called floor function. The floor function will calculate the greatest integer
这是所谓的阶梯函数 阶梯函数给出最大的整数值对于

91
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
less than or equal to <i>x</i>. The problem is to find where the limit does not exist
对于小于等于 <i>x</i> 问题是找出在哪些点极限不存在 

92
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:04,000
in the range from −2 to 2. Here’s a plot, and it’s clear that you have an issue at all the integers.
在区间 −2 到 2 可以从图中看出在所有整数点处都是有问题的 

93
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:13,000
They jump at every place. For example, at 0 you have the left-hand limit is −1
所有整数点处函数都有跳跃 例如 在 0 点左极限为 -1 

94
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and the right-hand limit is 0, so the limit does not exist. In fact, I can confirm that
而右极限为 0 所以极限不存在 事实上可以证明 

95
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:30,000
at every integer between −2 and 2, you have no limit existing. All the limits are indeterminate.
在 -2 到 2 之间的所有整数点处 极限都是不存在的 所有这些点的极限都是不确定的 

96
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The floor function is an example of a function which has no limit at an infinite number of points.
阶梯函数是一个函数在无穷多点极限不存在的例子 

97
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Now in practice, if we have a very complicated function like the one over here,
现在实践中 如果我们有一个非常复杂的函数 

98
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
then what you can try and do is to kind of squeeze the function between two simpler functions.
你可以试着将它限制在两个更简单的函数中间

99
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
A little more abstractly, if you have a function <i>g</i> and that function <i>g</i> lies between <i>f</i> and <i>h</i>
更抽象一点 如果你有一个在 <i>f</i> 和 <i>h</i> 之间的函数 <i>g</i> 

100
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and you know the limits of both <i>f</i> and <i>h</i>, then you also know the limit of <i>g</i>.
并且 <i>f</i> 和 <i>h</i> 的极限都已知 那么你也就得到了 <i>g</i> 的极限

101
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
With the function over here, you can see quite clearly that the cosine is going to go
对于这个函数 你可以看到余弦函数处于 

102
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
between −1 and 1, so you could pick <i>f</i> to be <i>x</i>^2 and pick <i>h</i> to be −<i>x</i>^2.
-1 和 1 之间 你可以选择 <i>f</i> 为 <i>x</i>^2 选择 <i>h</i> 为 −<i>x</i>^2 

103
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That’s going between −1 and 1. You’ve got <i>f</i>, you’ve got <i>g</i> and you’ve got <i>h</i>. <i>g</i> is the complicated one,
介于 -1 和 1 之间 已知 <i>f</i> <i>g</i> 和 <i>h</i>. <i>g</i> 是最复杂的 

104
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and if you plot them, you see that <i>g</i> is tightly squeezed between <i>f</i> and <i>h</i> near 0.
如果把它们全部绘制出来 你可以看到 <i>g</i> 在 0 附近严格地被夹在 <i>f</i> 和 <i>h</i> 之间 

105
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
<i>g</i> is this wiggly function over here, and it’s very tightly squeezed. The squeeze theorem says that
<i>g</i> 是这儿的上下波动的函数 并且紧密的夹在中间 两边夹定理说

106
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
you can work out the limit of <i>g</i> provided that you can find the limits of <i>f</i> and <i>h</i>.
如果你能得到函数 <i>f</i> 和 <i>h</i> 的极限 那么 <i>g</i> 的极限就能得到 

107
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But <i>f</i> and <i>h</i> are simple. They’re polynomials, so their limits are just 0,
然而 <i>f</i> 和 <i>h</i> 的极限十分简单 他们是多项式 所以 他们的极限为 0 

108
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and hence the limit of <i>g</i> is 0 as well.
因此 <i>g</i> 的极限也是 0 

109
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay. That brings me to the end of today’s lesson, and I’ll summarize by saying that
好 今天的课程到此结束 我来总结一下 

110
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
the limit laws give us a way to find the limits of functions mathematically.
极限法则给了我们一种数学上求函数极限的方法 

111
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You can use tables for sure, but the limit laws are the best ways to get the limits of functions.
你当然可以使用极限表 但是极限法则是计算函数极限的最好方式 

112
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:36,000
There are laws for sums, for differences, for products and for quotients. Now from these laws,
从和 差 积 商 的极限法则 

113
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
you can work out the law of finding limits for any polynomial. That’s really simple,
你可以得到多项式的极限法则

114
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
but it is somewhat harder to find the limits of rational functions which can become 0
但是会遇到一些困难在算有理函数的极限时 他会有 0 

115
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
in the denominator at some point or piecewise functions where things can go quite wrong, et cetera.
出现在分母上在某些点处 或者对一些分段函数甚至会更加糟糕 等等 

116
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Finally, the squeeze theorem is a great way to find limits when you are given difficult functions
最后 当你遇到一些求极限比较困难的函数时 两边夹定理是求极限的一种好方法 

117
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
which can be squeezed between simpler functions. This is about today’s lesson,
可以选择简单的函数来夹逼求极限 这就是今天的课程 

118
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and the next lesson, we’ll cover continuous functions, which will make life much easier for us
下节课 我们会讨论连续函数 这会使我们求极限的过程更简单 

119
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
as far as finding limits are concerned. But before that, we will have a problem session
不过在此之前 我们会有一个习题课

120
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,000
to discuss various problems which relate to the material covered so far. Do review today’s lesson,
来讨论一些与已经讲过的内容相关的问题 务必复习今天的课程 

121
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
go over the examples, the exercises and try and figure out how you might proceed
复习一下例子和练习，并试着 

122
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
by trying things on your own and mastering the area. Thank you very much. I’ll stop here.
自己试验并掌握这些知识 非常感谢 我就讲到这里
