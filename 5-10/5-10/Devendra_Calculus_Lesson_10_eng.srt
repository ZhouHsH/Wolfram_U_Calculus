00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 10 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The topic for this lesson is derivatives of trigonometric functions.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let’s begin with a brief overview of the lesson. Recall that the trigonometric functions

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
are oscillatory—so they go up and down like waves. You would expect that their derivatives

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
would oscillatory too. Here’s an example that illustrates that.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Here’s a function <i>f</i> which is composed of sine and cosine, and if you plot the function along with

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the derivative, then what you see is they are both oscillatory. The blue graph is <i>f</i>

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and the orange graph is <i>f</i>', and as <i>f</i> changes in an oscillatory way, so does <i>f</i>'.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But of course I haven’t told you how to find the derivative of <i>f</i>, and that’s the goal of today’s lesson.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The goal of this lesson is to develop a table of derivatives for trigonometric functions.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let’s begin with the sine function. Here’s the sine function, and to find the derivative,

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
we simply apply the definition—namely, it’s the limit of the difference quotient as <i>h</i> approaches 0—

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and you get back Cos[<i>x</i>].That says that the derivative of sine is cosine.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let’s confirm that with D. Here’s a plot of both the functions sine and cosine.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sine is the function and cosine is the derivative of the function.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let’s go on now to the cosine function. Once again, we apply the definition, and what you get back

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
this time is the negative of the sine. That’s important: the derivative of cosine

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
is the negative of the sine function. Let’s confirm that with D.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You get back −Sin[<i>x</i>]. Here is a plot of both the functions Cos[<i>x</i>] and its derivative −Sin[<i>x</i>].

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let’s go on further to the tangent function. Here’s <i>f</I> = Tan[<i>x</i>]. Work out the derivative with the definition

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and you get back Sec^2[<i>x</i>]—so that’s to be remembered, that the derivative of Tan[<i>x</i>] is Sec^2[<i>x</i>].

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let’s confirm that with D, and the question is why is there is a square in the answer?

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, when you plot <i>f</i> and the derivative, you see that the tangent function is always increasing,

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
so the derivative, as the slope of tangent is always non-negative—and that’s why the derivative

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
has got a square in it. So Sec^2 lies above the <i>x</i> axis.

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay. Now we go on to the reciprocals. The secant function has derivative

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Sec[<i>x</i>] * Tan[<i>x</i>], and here’s a confirmation with D. Let’s plot them both, and there you are.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Next we go on to the cosecant function. That’s the reciprocal of sine,

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and its derivative is negative of cotangent times cosecant. Confirm that with D,

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and once again we can plot it to get the function and its derivative.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Finally we got on to the cotangent function. Now its derivative turns out to be −Csc^2[<i>x</i>].

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You can confirm that with D, and the question is why is there a negative sign?

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, the point is that unlike the tangent, the cotangent is always decreasing,

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and so its derivative is always negative.

35
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay. Let’s summarize a bit. Here you have the six functions that we just spoke about—

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, cotanget—and here are their derivatives.

37
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That says that the derivative of sine is cosine, et cetera, and that small table is well worth memorizing

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:53,000
for all your future work. Let’s plot them, and you see that you have all the functions

39
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and their derivatives in just one picture, with the top three being sine, cosine, tangent,

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and the bottom being secant, cosecant and cotangent.

41
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay. Just a little bit about the higher derivatives of the trigonometric functions.

42
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We know that the trigonometric functions have a cyclical nature. You would expect that

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
there’s some kind of interesting pattern in their derivatives, and indeed that’s what happens.

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Here is a table of the first four derivatives of sine. You’ve got Sin[<i>x</i>]. Its derivative is Cos[<i>x</i>].

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Its derivative is −Sin[<i>x</i>], then −Cos[<i>x</i>] and then Sin[<i>x</i>]. You see that you’re back to Sin[<i>x</i>]

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
after a cycle of four derivatives, and that says that, for example, if I ask you

47
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
what is the 1,001st derivative of the sine function, you will say, oh yes, if we divide by 4

48
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
we just get 1 as the remainder, so the answer is Cos[<i>x</i>]. In fact, there is a very nice formula for

49
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the <i>n</i>th derivative of the sine function. It’s just Sin[<i>x</i> + <i>n</i> * <i>π</i>/2], and you can check that

50
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
that gives you the correct answers when you plug in the values of <i>n</i> as 1, 2, 3, 4, et cetera.

51
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Finally here is a plot of all the derivatives of Sin[<i>x</i>], and you see quite clearly that

52
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
you start off at sine, then you go to cosine, then you go to negative sine,

53
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
then you go to negative cosine, then you come back to sine.

54
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That is the end of today’s lesson, but let’s summarize. Because the trig functions are periodic,

55
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
then so are their derivatives. The derivative of sine is cosine.

56
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The derivative of cosine is negative sine. The derivative of tangent is secant squared.

57
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The derivative of secant is secant times tangent.

58
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant times cotangent.

59
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The derivative of cotangent is negative cosecant squared. That short list should be enough

60
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
for most applications. Now this is a very short lesson, but it’s a very useful lesson

61
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and it’s a very important lesson because the trig functions appear in all kinds of applications,

62
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
starting from the motions of particles around circles to the electric currents

63
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
that flow through wires, et cetera. Knowing the derivatives for these functions is a great step

64
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
in your knowledge of calculus. In the next lesson, we’ll talk about the so-called chain rule,

65
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
which deals with compositions of functions. But before then, do revise this lesson and make sure

66
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
you understand the trig function derivatives. I’ll stop over here.

67
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thank you very much. I hope you enjoyed the lesson.
