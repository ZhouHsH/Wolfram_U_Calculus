00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 6 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Our topic for today is continuity. Let’s begin with a brief overview of the idea for today’s lesson.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Begin by recalling if you have a polynomial like this one over here, then its limit at a point

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
is simply the value of the polynomial at that point. If you look at the polynomial <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>],

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
then I simply replace <i>x</i> by <i>a</i>, and I get the limit of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] as <i>x</i> approaches <i>a</i>.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That’s a very special property of polynomials and similar functions—namely, that their limit

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
at any point is just the value of those functions at that point, and such functions are called continuous.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A continuous function is one for which the limit at a point and the function value agree.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This lesson will give examples of continuous functions, functions that are not continuous,

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
so-called discontinuous functions, and we’ll also give a nice application of continuity.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let’s begin with the definition of continuous functions in a formal way.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A function is continuous at a point <i>a</i> if the value at <i>a</i> is equal to the limit of <i>f</i> at <i>a</i>.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
For a function to be continuous, three things must happen. First of all, it must be defined at that point.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The limit must exist at that point, and that’s not enough; the limit must be equal to

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
the value of the function at that point. The equality is a very important condition for continuity.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Very informally, a continuous function should have no gaps or breaks in its graph.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If you draw the graph of a function and it looks continuous—it has no gaps or breaks—

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
then in fact that’s very likely to be a continuous function. For example,

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
here is a function of <i>x</i> as a polynomial, and its value at 1 is the same as the limit.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You plot it, and sure enough, there is no break in the graph, so that is a continuous function.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That’s just a simple way to tell if a function is continuous or not.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay. Some simple examples. Polynomials and rational functions are continuous

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
wherever they are defined. Here’s a polynomial <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] and a rational function <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>].

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
<i>f</i> is of course continuous at every point, but <i>g</i> is continuous everywhere except at −1,

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
where the denominator is 0, so it’s not defined. Here’s a plot of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], nice and continuous,

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and a plot of <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>], which has a problem, a discontinuity at −1.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay. Next let’s talk about functions which are not continuous. A function that is not continuous

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
is said to be discontinuous at that point. Here are two examples, <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] and <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>].

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Now if you think about <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], there’s a problem at 1. If you find the value at 1, sure enough,

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the answer is indeterminate. That function has a discontinuity at <i>x</i> = 1.

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now what’s happened with <i>g</i> is that we’ve chained the value at 1 hoping to fix the problem,

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:49,000
but that’s still not good enough because the limit as you approach 1 is −3, while the value is −2.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you plot the functions, you see that <i>f</i> has a problem at 1, which you can’t really see over here,

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
but that’s the fact from the definition, whereas <i>g</i>

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
did not quite fix it because you chose the wrong value at that discontinuity.

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Of course you’ve got to fix it, but the whole point is to construct examples

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
where things can go wrong for continuity.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay. A second class of examples here is a piecewise function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>],

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and clearly that’s problematic at 0 because you’re dividing by 0.

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That’s the floor function <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>], so <i>f</i> clearly has a discontinuity at 0.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You can see that. You’ve got ∞ over here and 0 over there, whereas <i>g</i> is a bit more complicated.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It’s got discontinuities at all integers. For example, at 0 it’s indeterminate,

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
the limit, and the value at 0 itself is 0, so clearly there’s a problem at that point. Here are the functions.

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
<i>f</i> only has a problem at 0, while <i>g</i> seems to have many more problems in its graph.

45
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay. Although the floor function is discontinuous, it does have one nice property,

46
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
namely that if you approach it from the right, then things are okay, but they are not from the left.

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let’s see that for the floor function. If you try and find the limit from the right,

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
from above for the floor function at 0, then it’s okay. You get back True.

49
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But if you try and find it from the left, it is not okay. The plot clearly says that we have issues at

50
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
all the integers, but in fact you have a function, the floor function,

51
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
which is continuous from the right at every integer, but not from the left.

52
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay. Root functions are also very similar to polynomials because they’re continuous

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
everywhere in their domains. Wherever they are defined, you are okay.

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Here’s a square root function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], and that’s continuous wherever it is defined,

55
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
namely, when <i>x</i> is non-negative. But at −1, it’s got an imaginary value <i>i</i>,

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
so one cannot really talk about continuity at that point. Here’s a graph,

57
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and as long as the function is defined, there is no problem at all; it is continuous.

58
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay. Trigonometric functions are pretty simple. The sine function and the cosine function

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
are both continuous at 0, and in fact, they are continuous at every point. Here’s a graph of

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
each of these functions. They are clearly continuous—there are no breaks—and one way to prove that

61
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
might be to use the addition formulae from algebra, from trigonometry, which can be used

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
to show that these functions are actually continuous at every point. On the other hand,

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
the tangent function has a problem because the denominator has cosine, so it is not continuous

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
whenever the cosine is 0. You can see the problems over here at every place where

65
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
cosine becomes 0 like π/2, et cetera, there are problems with the tangent function.

66
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay. If you want to go further, then one needs the laws of continuity. Just like you have

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
the laws for limits, you also have the laws for continuity. You have the sum law, which says that

68
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
if <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> are continuous, then so is <i>f</i> + <i>g</i>. You have the difference law,

69
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
which says that <i>f</i> − <i>g</i> is also continuous if <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> are so; the scalar multiplication law,

70
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
which says you can multiply by constants and still get continuity; the product law for products;

71
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and the quotient law for quotients. Together they give you a nice way of showing that

72
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
fairly complicated functions are in fact continuous. Here’s a function <i>f</i>.

73
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It looks pretty complicated, but then you can think about it and say oh yes, cosine is continuous,

74
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
so is sine; now you are dividing over here, you are adding there, et cetera,

75
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
so by the laws of continuity, this function is continuous. If you find the value at π, the answer is

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
the same as the limit at π. That’s a powerful way of showing that a function is continuous,

77
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
namely, to apply the laws of continuity just like one could apply the laws of limits.

78
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay. A slightly harder problem is what happens if a function is a composition,

79
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:57,000
so it’s <i>f</i>[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]]. Well, in that case you simply let the limit go, so to speak, inside the bracket,

80
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and if you still get the same answers then you’re okay, and that’s exactly what’s happening over here

81
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
in this case. Basically you have <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] defined as cosine of a polynomial, but cosine is continuous;

82
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
so is a polynomial. This function is a composition of trigs and polynomials. If you look at the graphs,

83
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
everything looks fine, and in fact the function is continuous. The point is that

84
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
given a composition of functions, you can basically ensure they’re continuous

85
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
by looking at each piece separately. In this case, you looked at <i>x</i>^2 − 7<i>x</i> + 10,

86
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and we looked at cosine and then we were done.

87
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay. We are almost done with today’s lesson, but one last important theme is that

88
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
you can actually apply the idea of continuity in practice to find roots.

89
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The theorem that helps to do that is the intermediate value theorem. That means

90
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
the theorem for the values between two values. What it says is that

91
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
if you have a continuous function <i>f</i> on an interval <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> and you have any number <i>n</i>

92
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
between <i>f</i>[<i>a</i>] and <i>f</i>[<i>b</i>], then you will have a value somewhere in the middle.

93
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That <i>f</i>[<i>c</i>] is equal to <i>n</i>. Basically a continuous function will take every value

94
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
between any two of its values. Of course one must assume that they are distinct

95
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to get some kind of interesting behavior, but basically you can assume for continuous functions

96
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
that they take every value between any two of their values. Let’s try and find the root of

97
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
this rather complicated looking polynomial <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]. It’s a cubic polynomial. Now you want to find

98
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
the root between 1 and 2, so what you do is you first of all evaluate at 1 and 2.

99
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You find that it’s negative here, it’s positive there, so because the function is continuous,

100
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and because 0 lies between those two numbers over here, then there must be a root in the interval.

101
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Using the intermediate value theorem, you can now check by the plot of my Solve

102
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
that now there is in fact actually a root, and that root in this case is about 1.63334.

103
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:41,000
People who try and solve equations will often apply this theorem to try and find a root of a function.

104
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That’s a very powerful application of continuity. It’s not just a theoretical concept,

105
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
it’s a very powerful practical concept.

106
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Okay. We are done for today’s lesson. Let’s summarize. Basically, continuous functions

107
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
are very common in the real world, and in fact, most functions you’ll meet are going to be continuous.

108
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There really is no problem at all. We did see some examples, but they were somewhat artificial

109
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
in some cases, and you don’t need to worry about them mostly.

110
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Informally, a continuous function has no gaps or breaks in its graph. If you look at

111
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
polynomials’ root functions, they are continuous wherever they are defined.

112
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That’s no issue for polynomials, but for root functions like the square root, you do need

113
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
to worry about where they are defined. Now rational functions and trigs are slightly harder.

114
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They may or may not be continuous. That depends upon the kind of way that they are being set up.

115
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Finally, the intermediate value theorem is a very powerful way to find the roots of functions.

116
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That’s the end of the discussion of continuity for today, and in the next lesson,

117
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
we’ll begin discussing differential calculus by using limits to define so-called derivatives.

118
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That’s where calculus really becomes useful in a very profound way. Next lesson is a time

119
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
we start looking deeper into calculus, but before doing that, do review today’s lesson,

120
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
try and solve the exercises and be ready for the next time. It was great to present this to you.

121
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you very much.
