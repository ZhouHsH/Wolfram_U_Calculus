00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 9 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Our topic for today is differentiation formulas. Let’s begin with a brief overview of today’s lesson.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The point is that one can find derivatives using the limit definition, but in practice

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
this is quite a tedious and tricky approach, and one wishes that there was some simpler way

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
of finding derivatives in practice. Luckily there are formulas which help us to find derivatives

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:48,000
of many commonly occurring functions. For example, here is a constant function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] = <i>c</i>,

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and you can see over here that the derivative of this function is just 0. The derivative of

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:07,000
a constant function is always 0. Let’s check the graphs. Here is a graph of the function,

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and the derivative is 0. In this lesson, what we’ll do is we’ll cover basic differentiation formulas

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
of this type, and by the end of today’s lesson, you’ll feel quite comfortable about

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
computing derivatives in practice.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
As a first example, here are the power functions. You have a function <i>x</i>^<i>n</i>.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
For different values of <i>n</i>, you get different power functions. Taking this function

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and finding its derivative gives you <i>n</i> * <i>x</i>^(<i>n</i> − 1). That’s a very well-known formula

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
in differential calculus. For example, if <i>n</i> is 2, then you have a quadratic function

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and its derivative is just 2<i>x</i>. It might be good to memorize that the derivative of <i>x</i>^2 is 2<i>x</i>.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let’s plot the function and derivative. That’s the function, a quadratic function, a parabola,

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and that’s the derivative, and clearly the derivative must be negative on the left

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
because the function is decreasing, so the slopes are all negative over here.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Going to the same topic, suppose you have <i>x</i>^−1. That’s a negative number,

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
but the same rule applies and you get back −1/<i>x</i>^2 as the answer. Again, here is a plot of the function

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and its derivative. Finally let’s take an example where you actually have

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
a kind of negative decimal power. But the same formula applies, and you get back

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
a derivative in the same form, <i>n</i> * <i>x</i>^(<i>n</i> − 1).

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay. To go further, let’s now talk about constant multiples of functions. Here you have

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
a constant and a function, and when you try to find the derivative, what you do is you simply

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
pull out the constant from the function where you’re trying finding the derivative.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The derivative over here is just 15<i>x</i>^2, which is just 5 times 3<i>x</i>^2, so the 15<i>x</i>^2 over here

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:18,000
the constant 5 times 3<i>x</i>^2, which is the derivative of <i>x</i>^3. Here’s a plot of the function and derivative,

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and you can see that this is a very simple rule, the constant multiple rule.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To go a step further, let’s look at a very important rule named the sum rule.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you have a function <i>f</I> and a function <i>g</i> and you find their sum, then the derivative of the sum

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
is just the sum of the derivatives. So you simply work out <i>f</i>' and <i>g</i>' separately,

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and then when you add them up, in this case you get back 6<i>x</i> + 2, which is the correct answer.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The sum rule makes it quite simple to find the derivative in such cases. Once again, here’s a plot.

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You have the function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], the function <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>], and the derivatives over here are <i>f</i>'[<i>x</i>],  <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>],

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and the sum has got a derivative, which is the sum of those two.

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay. On to the difference rule, which is very simple and similar.

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If you’ve got a function <i>f</i> and a function <i>g</i> and you define their difference,

40
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
then then derivative of the difference is the difference of the derivatives—

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
namely, you work out <i>f</I>'[<i>x</i>], work out <i>g</i>'[<i>x</i>] and then you subtract them, and you get back

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:56,000
the answer for the difference derivative. Here’s a plot of all the derivatives. Once again you see that

43
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
if you have a difference, then the derivative is really simple to compute.

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Sums are simple. Differences are simple. The question is what happens to products.

45
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Well, if you have a function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] and then a function <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>] and you multiply them to get the product,

46
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
you might think that the derivative of the product is the product of the derivatives,

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
but that is not the case. In fact, if you work it out over here you get √<i>x</i> in one case

48
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and you get quite a different answer in the other. It turns out that in this case,

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:47,000
the correct formula is you do <i>f</i> * <i>g</i>' + <i>g</i> * <i>f</i>', and then you do get back the correct answer

50
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
for the derivative of the product. Once again, here’s a plot of all three derivatives

51
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
to give you a feeling for what’s happening over here, but notice that now things are no longer simple.

52
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You actually do need to memorize a rule which says that the derivative of

53
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:17,000
the product of <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> is <i>f</i> * <i>g</i>' + <i>g</i> * <i>f</i>', and as if this is not complicated enough,

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
let’s look at the quotient rule. If you have <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> and you take their quotient,

55
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:33,000
so you divide them, then once again the derivative of the quotient is not the quotient of the derivatives.

56
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You can check that over here. If you do <i>f</i>'/<i>g</i>', you get one answer;

57
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
if you find the derivative directly for the quotient, you get another answer.

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The fact is that the quotient rule for derivatives is a lot harder. It says that

59
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:02,000
the derivative is (<i>g</i> * <i>f</i>' − <i>f</i> * <i>g</i>')/<i>g</i>^2. In this case, the rule gives you the correct answer,

60
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:14,000
namely, −3/2<i>x</i>^3. Once again you can plot all the derivatives, and you learn that the quotient rule

61
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
is significantly more complicated than the earlier rules, but in fact it does give you

62
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
the correct answer in all cases. We’ve learned the sum rule, the difference rule, the product rule

63
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and the quotient rule, and in fact that brings us to the end of today’s lesson.

64
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The point is that yes, derivatives are useful, but it is only when you have the rules for differentiation

65
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
that you can actually use them effectively in practice, so you do need to know all the rules we learned today.

66
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:58,000
There are rules for sums, differences, products and quotients. Of course the simplest rule is the power rule,

67
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
which lets you find the derivative of things like <i>x</i>^2 and <i>x</i>^3 and other powers of <i>x</i>.

68
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
In the next lesson, we’ll go on to doing something more with derivatives, namely,

69
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
talking about the trigonometric functions. But before we do that,

70
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
do make sure you review today’s lesson, try the exercises and make sure

71
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
you’re ready for the next theme, which is the derivatives of trigonometric functions.

72
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I’ll stop over here. I hope you found this lesson really useful. This is where calculus really begins,

73
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
where it becomes a very algebraic kind of process and becomes easy to apply in practice.

74
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Thank you very much. I’ll stop over here.
