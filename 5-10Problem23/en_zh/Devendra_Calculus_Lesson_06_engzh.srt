00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 6 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.
你好 欢迎来到 Wolfram U 的微积分入门课程第 6 课

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Our topic for today is continuity. Let’s begin with a brief overview of the idea for today’s lesson.
今天我们的主题是连续性 首先 简要概述一下本课的内容

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Begin by recalling if you have a polynomial like this one over here, then its limit at a point
首先回想一下对于一个多项式 他在某一点的极限就是

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
is simply the value of the polynomial at that point. If you look at the polynomial <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>],
该点处多项式的值 如果你观察多项式 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
then I simply replace <i>x</i> by <i>a</i>, and I get the limit of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] as <i>x</i> approaches <i>a</i>.
然后我将 <i>x</i> 替换为 <i>a</i> 便得到 <i>x</i>　趋近　<i>a</i>　时 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 的极限

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That’s a very special property of polynomials and similar functions—namely, that their limit
这是多项式和类似函数的一个非常特殊的性质 它们在任何时候的极限

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
at any point is just the value of those functions at that point, and such functions are called continuous.
都是这些函数的函数值 这种函数称之为连续函数

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A continuous function is one for which the limit at a point and the function value agree.
连续函数是任意一点的极限与其函数值一致的函数

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This lesson will give examples of continuous functions, functions that are not continuous,
本课将提供连续函数和不连续的一些函数的示例

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
so-called discontinuous functions, and we’ll also give a nice application of continuity.
即不连续函数 而且我们还会给出一个很好的连续性的应用

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let’s begin with the definition of continuous functions in a formal way.
我们连续函数的正式定义开始

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A function is continuous at a point <i>a</i> if the value at <i>a</i> is equal to the limit of <i>f</i> at <i>a</i>.
如果函数在　<i>a</i>　处的值等于他在　<i>a</i> 处 <i>f</i> 的极限 则称函数在点 <i>a</i> 处连续

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
For a function to be continuous, three things must happen. First of all, it must be defined at that point.
函数如果想要是连续的 必须满足三个条件 首先 他必须在这点有定义

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The limit must exist at that point, and that’s not enough; the limit must be equal to
然后他在这点的极限要存在 但这还不够 还得有极限必须等于

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
the value of the function at that point. The equality is a very important condition for continuity.
该点的函数值 极限与函数值相等是函数连续的非常重要的条件

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Very informally, a continuous function should have no gaps or breaks in its graph.
不严谨的说 连续函数在其图像里不应该有间隙或中断 

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If you draw the graph of a function and it looks continuous—it has no gaps or breaks—
如果你绘制的函数图看起来是连续的 也就是没有任何间隙或中断的

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
then in fact that’s very likely to be a continuous function. For example,
那么这个函数很可能就是连续函数 例如

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
here is a function of <i>x</i> as a polynomial, and its value at 1 is the same as the limit.
这里有一个以　<i>x</i> 为自变量的多项式函数 并且其函数在 1 这个点与极限相同

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You plot it, and sure enough, there is no break in the graph, so that is a continuous function.
画出图像 可以肯定的是 图中没有中断 因此这是一个连续函数

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That’s just a simple way to tell if a function is continuous or not.
这只是判断一个函数是否连续的一种简单方法

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay. Some simple examples. Polynomials and rational functions are continuous
好 一些简单的例子 多项式和有理函数是连续的

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
wherever they are defined. Here’s a polynomial <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] and a rational function <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>].
在他们有定义的地方 这是多项式函数 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 和有理函数 <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
<i>f</i> is of course continuous at every point, but <i>g</i> is continuous everywhere except at −1,
<i>f</i> 当然在每个点上都是连续的 但是 <i>g</i> 在所有地方都是连续的 除了在 −1 处

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
where the denominator is 0, so it’s not defined. Here’s a plot of <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], nice and continuous,
此处分母为 0 所以函数未定义 这是一个 <i>f</i>[ <i>x ]</i> 的图像 很不错而且连续 

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and a plot of <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>], which has a problem, a discontinuity at −1.
以及 <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>] 的图 该图有个问题 即在 -1 处不连续

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay. Next let’s talk about functions which are not continuous. A function that is not continuous
好 接下来让我们讨论不连续的函数 函数是不连续的

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
is said to be discontinuous at that point. Here are two examples, <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] and <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>].
是说他在这点是间断的 这是两个示例 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 和 <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Now if you think about <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], there’s a problem at 1. If you find the value at 1, sure enough,
现在 如果考虑 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 那么问题就出在 1 上了 如果你去找 <i>x</i> = 1 点的函数值

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the answer is indeterminate. That function has a discontinuity at <i>x</i> = 1.
那么答案是不确定的 该函数在 <i>x</i> = 1 处不连续

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now what’s happened with <i>g</i> is that we’ve chained the value at 1 hoping to fix the problem,
现在 <i>g</i> 上发生的事情是 我们将函数在 <i>x</i> = 1 点的值以分段函数的形式连接起来以解决问题

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:49,000
but that’s still not good enough because the limit as you approach 1 is −3, while the value is −2.
但这仍然不够好 因为当您接近1时 极限是 -3 而函数值是 -2 

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you plot the functions, you see that <i>f</i> has a problem at 1, which you can’t really see over here,
如果画图 你会发现 <i>f</i> 在 <i>x</i> = 1 处有问题 实际上在这儿看不出来

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
but that’s the fact from the definition, whereas <i>g</i>
但这是定义中的事实 而 <i>g</i>

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
did not quite fix it because you chose the wrong value at that discontinuity.
并没有完全解决它 因为你在该不连续的地方选择了错误的值

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Of course you’ve got to fix it, but the whole point is to construct examples
当然 你不得不其进行处理 但重点是构造一些例子

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
where things can go wrong for continuity.
连续性在他们身上会出问题

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay. A second class of examples here is a piecewise function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>],
好 此处的第二类示例是分段函数 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and clearly that’s problematic at 0 because you’re dividing by 0.
显然 这是 0 这个点的问题 因为你要除以 0 

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That’s the floor function <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>], so <i>f</i> clearly has a discontinuity at 0.
这是下取整函数 <i>g</i>[<i>x</i>] 因此显然 <i>f</i> 在 0 处具有不连续性

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You can see that. You’ve got ∞ over here and 0 over there, whereas <i>g</i> is a bit more complicated.
可以看到 极限为 ∞ 而函数值为 0 但是 <i>g</i> 就有点复杂

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It’s got discontinuities at all integers. For example, at 0 it’s indeterminate,
所有整数点都不连续 例如 在 <i>x</i> = 0 时它的极限值不确定

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
the limit, and the value at 0 itself is 0, so clearly there’s a problem at that point. Here are the functions.
在 0 点的函数值是 0 因此显然在这点上有问题 这是函数图像

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
<i>f</i> only has a problem at 0, while <i>g</i> seems to have many more problems in its graph.
<i>f</i> 仅仅在 0 处有问题 而 <i>g</i> 在其图中似乎还有更多问题

45
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay. Although the floor function is discontinuous, it does have one nice property,
好 尽管下取整函数是不连续的 但它确实具有一个不错的性质

46
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
namely that if you approach it from the right, then things are okay, but they are not from the left.
就是说 如果你从右侧接近 则一切正常 但从左侧开始就不行

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let’s see that for the floor function. If you try and find the limit from the right,
让我们看看下取整函数 如果你尝试从右侧趋近求极限

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
from above for the floor function at 0, then it’s okay. You get back True.
设置 Direction 属性为 FromAbove 那么就可以了 你得了到正确结果
设置 Direction 属性为 FromAbove 那么就可以了 你得了到正确结果

49
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But if you try and find it from the left, it is not okay. The plot clearly says that we have issues at
但是 如果您尝试从左侧求极限 那就不行了 该图清楚地表明

50
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
all the integers, but in fact you have a function, the floor function,
我们在所有整数点上都会出问题 但实际上下取整函数

51
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
which is continuous from the right at every integer, but not from the left.
在每个整数点处从右趋近是连续的 但从左侧趋近是不连续的

52
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay. Root functions are also very similar to polynomials because they’re continuous
好的 根式函数也与多项式非常相似 因为它们在其定义域中的

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
everywhere in their domains. Wherever they are defined, you are okay.
任何地方都是连续的 在所有有定义的点 都是连续的

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Here’s a square root function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], and that’s continuous wherever it is defined,
这是平方根函数 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 无论在那个有定义的点 它都是连续的

55
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
namely, when <i>x</i> is non-negative. But at −1, it’s got an imaginary value <i>i</i>,
也就是说 当 <i>x</i> 非负时都连续 但是在 −1 处有一个虚数值 <i>i</i>

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
so one cannot really talk about continuity at that point. Here’s a graph,
因此我们不谈论在这一点的连续性 这是图

57
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and as long as the function is defined, there is no problem at all; it is continuous.
函数是有定义的 就完全没有问题 它是连续的

58
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay. Trigonometric functions are pretty simple. The sine function and the cosine function
好 三角函数就非常简单 正弦函数和余弦函数

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
are both continuous at 0, and in fact, they are continuous at every point. Here’s a graph of
都在 0 处连续 实际上 它们在每个点处都连续

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
each of these functions. They are clearly continuous—there are no breaks—and one way to prove that
这是每个函数的图 他们显然是连续的——没有间断——并且有一种证明

61
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
might be to use the addition formulae from algebra, from trigonometry, which can be used
可能是使用来自三角函数代数化的加法公式 这些公式可以用来

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
to show that these functions are actually continuous at every point. On the other hand,
表明这些函数实际上在每个点都是连续的 另一方面

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
the tangent function has a problem because the denominator has cosine, so it is not continuous
正切函数有一个问题 因为分母实际是余弦函数

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
whenever the cosine is 0. You can see the problems over here at every place where
所以每当余弦为 0 时它就不是连续的 你可以在这里看到余弦在

65
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
cosine becomes 0 like π/2, et cetera, there are problems with the tangent function.
π/2 这些点变为 0 在这些点处正切函数不连续

66
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay. If you want to go further, then one needs the laws of continuity. Just like you have
好 更进一步 那么就需要连续性法则

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
the laws for limits, you also have the laws for continuity. You have the sum law, which says that
就像你有极限法则一样 你也有连续性法则 我们有加法法则 它说

68
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
if <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> are continuous, then so is <i>f</i> + <i>g</i>. You have the difference law,
如果 <i>f</i> 和 <i>g</i> 是连续的 则 <i>f</i> + <i>g</i> 也是如此

69
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
which says that <i>f</i> − <i>g</i> is also continuous if <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> are so; the scalar multiplication law,
减法法则 即如果 <i>f</i>和 <i>g</i> 如此 <i>f</i> − <i>g</i> 也是连续的 数乘法法则 

70
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
which says you can multiply by constants and still get continuity; the product law for products;
这表示你可以用常数乘连续函数乘 但仍可以保持连续性 乘法法则

71
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and the quotient law for quotients. Together they give you a nice way of showing that
和商法则 他们一起为你提供了一种很好的方式来证明

72
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
fairly complicated functions are in fact continuous. Here’s a function <i>f</i>.
相当复杂的函数实际上是连续的 这是函数 <i>f</i> 

73
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It looks pretty complicated, but then you can think about it and say oh yes, cosine is continuous,
他看起来很复杂 但是 你可以考虑一下 然后说 是的 余弦是连续的 

74
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
so is sine; now you are dividing over here, you are adding there, et cetera,
正弦也是连续的 现在您在这里除 在这里加 等等

75
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
so by the laws of continuity, this function is continuous. If you find the value at π, the answer is
因此 根据连续性法则 此函数是连续的 如果在 π 计算到该函数的值 则答案

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
the same as the limit at π. That’s a powerful way of showing that a function is continuous,
与在 π 处的极限相同 这是一种强有力的方式来表明一个函数是连续的

77
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
namely, to apply the laws of continuity just like one could apply the laws of limits.
就是说 可以像应用极限定律一样应用连续性法则

78
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay. A slightly harder problem is what happens if a function is a composition,
好 一个稍微棘手的问题是 如果一个函数是一个复合函数 会发生什么

79
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:57,000
so it’s <i>f</i>[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]]. Well, in that case you simply let the limit go, so to speak, inside the bracket,
比如 <i>f</i>[<i>g</i>[<i>x</i>]] 好吧 在那种情况下 你只需要先在括号内求极限

80
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and if you still get the same answers then you’re okay, and that’s exactly what’s happening over here
如果仍然得到相同的答案 那么就可以了 这就是这里正在发生的事情

81
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
in this case. Basically you have <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] defined as cosine of a polynomial, but cosine is continuous;
在这种情况下 基本上 你将 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 定义为多项式的余弦 但余弦是连续的

82
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
so is a polynomial. This function is a composition of trigs and polynomials. If you look at the graphs,
多项式也是连续的 此函数由多项式和多项式组成

83
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
everything looks fine, and in fact the function is continuous. The point is that
如果你看图 那么一切看起来都很好 实际上 该函数就是连续的 关键是

84
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
given a composition of functions, you can basically ensure they’re continuous
给定函数的复合 基本上可以通过分别检查每个部分来确保他们是连续的

85
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
by looking at each piece separately. In this case, you looked at <i>x</i>^2 − 7<i>x</i> + 10,
在这种情况下 你检查了 <i>x</i>^2 − 7<i>x</i> + 10

86
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and we looked at cosine and then we were done.
然后我们检查余弦 然后就完了

87
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay. We are almost done with today’s lesson, but one last important theme is that
好 今天的课程差不多完成了 但是最后一个重要主题是

88
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
you can actually apply the idea of continuity in practice to find roots.
你可以在实践中实际应用连续性的思想来找根

89
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The theorem that helps to do that is the intermediate value theorem. That means
帮助你做到这一点的定理的是介值定理 这意味着是

90
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
the theorem for the values between two values. What it says is that
这意味是关于着两个值之间的函数值的定理 它说的是

91
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
if you have a continuous function <i>f</i> on an interval <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> and you have any number <i>n</i>
如果在 <i>a</i> 到 <i>b</i> 的区间上具有连续函数 <i>f</i> 并且有任意函数值 <i>n</i>

92
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
between <i>f</i>[<i>a</i>] and <i>f</i>[<i>b</i>], then you will have a value somewhere in the middle.
介于 <i>f</i>[<i>a</i>] 和 <i>f</i>[<i>b</i>] 之间 则必有一个在 <i>a</i>  <i>b</i> 中间的某个地方的 <i>c</i>

93
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That <i>f</i>[<i>c</i>] is equal to <i>n</i>. Basically a continuous function will take every value
使得 <i>f</i>[<i>c</i>] 等于 <i>n</i> 基本上 一个连续函数可以取到其任意两个函数值之间的每个值

94
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
between any two of its values. Of course one must assume that they are distinct
当然 必须假定这两个函数值是不同的

95
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to get some kind of interesting behavior, but basically you can assume for continuous functions
以便使讨论有意义 但基本上 可以假定对连续函数而言

96
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
that they take every value between any two of their values. Let’s try and find the root of
他可以取到两个函数值之间的任意一个值 让我们尝试去求根

97
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
this rather complicated looking polynomial <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>]. It’s a cubic polynomial. Now you want to find
这个相当复杂的多项式 <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] 他是三次多项式 现在想找

98
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
the root between 1 and 2, so what you do is you first of all evaluate at 1 and 2.
到他在 1 到 2 之间的根 所以首先要做的就是求 1 和 2 处的函数值

99
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You find that it’s negative here, it’s positive there, so because the function is continuous,
你会发现 1 点的函数值是负数 2 点的函数值是正数 由于函数是连续的

100
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and because 0 lies between those two numbers over here, then there must be a root in the interval.
并且因为 0 在这两个数字之间 所以区间中必须存在一个根

101
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Using the intermediate value theorem, you can now check by the plot of my Solve
使用介值定理 你现在可以通过图像来检查所求的根

102
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
that now there is in fact actually a root, and that root in this case is about 1.63334.
这里确实有一个根 这里 根约为1.63334

103
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:41,000
People who try and solve equations will often apply this theorem to try and find a root of a function.
尝试求解方程式的人们通常会应用该定理来尝试寻找函数的根

104
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That’s a very powerful application of continuity. It’s not just a theoretical concept,
这是连续性的非常强大的应用 他不仅是一个理论概念

105
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
it’s a very powerful practical concept.
而且是一个非常有力的实践概念

106
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Okay. We are done for today’s lesson. Let’s summarize. Basically, continuous functions
好 今天的课程到这儿 让我们总结一下

107
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
are very common in the real world, and in fact, most functions you’ll meet are going to be continuous.
基本上 连续函数在现实世界中非常普遍 实际上 你遇到的大多数函数都是连续的

108
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There really is no problem at all. We did see some examples, but they were somewhat artificial
这完全没有问题 我们确实看到了一些不连续函数的示例 但是某种意义上它们是人为的

109
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
in some cases, and you don’t need to worry about them mostly.
因此你不用特别担心

110
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Informally, a continuous function has no gaps or breaks in its graph. If you look at
不严谨的说 连续函数在其图形中没有间隙或中断

111
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
polynomials’ root functions, they are continuous wherever they are defined.
如果你关注的是多项式函数 根式函数 则无论在那个有定义的地方他们都是连续的

112
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That’s no issue for polynomials, but for root functions like the square root, you do need
对于多项式来说这不是问题 但是对于平方根之类的根式函数

113
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
to worry about where they are defined. Now rational functions and trigs are slightly harder.
确实需要担心它们的定义域 有理函数和三角函数要难一些

114
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They may or may not be continuous. That depends upon the kind of way that they are being set up.
他们可能是连续的 也可能不是连续的 这取决于他们的具体形式

115
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Finally, the intermediate value theorem is a very powerful way to find the roots of functions.
最后 介值定理是求根的一种非常有效的方法

116
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That’s the end of the discussion of continuity for today, and in the next lesson,
今天连续性的讨论到此结束 在下一课中

117
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
we’ll begin discussing differential calculus by using limits to define so-called derivatives.
我们将通过使用极限定义的所谓的导数来讨论微积分

118
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That’s where calculus really becomes useful in a very profound way. Next lesson is a time
这就是微积分真正以非常深刻的方式变得有用的地方 下节课

119
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
we start looking deeper into calculus, but before doing that, do review today’s lesson,
我们开始更深入地研究微积分 但在此之前 请认真复习今天的课程

120
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
try and solve the exercises and be ready for the next time. It was great to present this to you.
尝试解决这些问题 并为下一次课做好准备 很高兴讲这次课

121
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you very much.
