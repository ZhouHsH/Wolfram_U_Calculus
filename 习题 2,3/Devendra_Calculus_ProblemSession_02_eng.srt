00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome to Problem Session 2 of this introduction to calculus with Wolfram U.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Our topic for today is derivatives and continuity. Now being a problem session,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we’ll discuss a few problems, but the point will be to try to show you how to solve

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
real problems in calculus, and also how to review the concepts that you’ve learned earlier

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
by looking at real examples. Let’s begin with the first problem for today, and that says

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
find the limit of <i>x</i> * Sin[<i>x</i>] + Cos[<i>x</i>] as <i>x</i> goes to π. Now keep in mind that <i>x</i> is continuous

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and so is Sin[<i>x</i>] and so is Cos[<i>x</i>], so the entire expression over here is continuous,

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and hence what you can do is you can simply plug in the value π into it. If you do that,

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
then the answer is −1. You expect that the limit is going to be −1, and you can compute the limit

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
with the Limit function and get just the same answer. Here’s a plot of the function around π,

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and you see that the value is actually −1 around there.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay. Let’s go onto problem 2, which asks you to compute the limit of Sin[<i>x</i>^2 – 3<i>x</i>] as <I>x</i> approaches 3.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now the point is that sine is a continuous function, so you can basically take the limit

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
inside the bracket over here and work out that simple limit, which is just 9 – 9, so that’s 0.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You expect the limit is going to be 0 for the entire expression, and you can confirm that with Limit

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and get back the same answer, 0. Here is a plot, and the plot shows you

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
that indeed the limit is 0 at <i>x</i> = 3.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay. Problem 3 asks you to find the limit as <i>x</i> approaches 9 of this function over here.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now the point is that when <i>x</i> is 9, we have an issue because the denominator becomes 0 at <i>x</i> = 9

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
because that’s 81 − 81. That’s 0, so you can not evaluate the limit that the quotient law as given to you.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But what you can do is to try and cancel a common factor by first multiplying the top and the bottom

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
by 3 + √<i>x</i>, and if we do that, you see that we now have the required factor 9 – <i>x</i>,

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
which cancels with the denominator, and if you do that, you can simplify. Then you get back

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
an expression which no longer has any problem with computing limits. If you now plug in <i>x</i> = 9,

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
you would expect to get 54 over here, so the answer is 1/54 for this limit.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That’s a bit difficult because you had to do some work to get to the answer,

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
but typically limits of rational functions or rational expressions are a bit more complicated.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Problem 4 asks you to show that there is a root of this expression over here between 2 and 3.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now that should remind you of the intermediate value theorem, which says that

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the if sign of the expression is different at the two ends, then you actually have a root in the middle.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If you compute the expression at 2 you get −5 point something, and at 3 you get a positive number.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You have a negative value at one end, a positive value at the other end, so there must be

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
a root in the interval 2 to 3. You can confirm that with Solve, and actually you compute the value,

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
which is about 2.39. Here’s the plot, and you can see the function does becomes 0 around 2.4,

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
so that agrees with the value given by Solve. Like we said earlier on, the intermediate value theorem

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
is a very powerful tool for identifying roots of functions.

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay. Problem 5 says find the value of <i>a</i> which will make this piecewise expression continuous,

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and clearly the only problem is at 1. Now what you need to do is to fit the value of <i>a</i>

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
so the function becomes continuous at 1. Now at 1, if you work out the function value it’s 3,

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and the limit from the right-hand side is also 3 because if you plug in 1 over here,

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
you get back 3, so you need to fit the value of <i>a</i> so that the left-hand limit is 3 as well.

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You can do that with the Solve function, and get <i>a</i> to be 6. Now once you do that,

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
then the function becomes 6<i>x</i> − 3 instead of 8<i>x</i> − 3 for <i>x</i> less than 1, and if you plot it now,

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
it looks nice and continuous—although it does have a corner over here—but there is

45
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
no problem with the continuity. <i>a</i> = 6 is required for making this expression continuous at 1.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Problem 6 says find the limit of (1/<i>x</i> – 1/3)/(<i>x</i> – 3). Now that’s just a derivative

47
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
because that’s like a difference quotient. You can work out the answer using D,

48
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
or you could work out the limit directly and get back the same answer.

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Here is a plot which shows that in fact you do have a tangent line at this point over here.

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Working the limit in this case could be done either by using D or by doing a limit calculation.

51
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay. Problem number 7 says compute the left-hand derivative of this expression at 1.

52
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
First we set up the function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>] with the given expression. You want to find the left-hand derivative,

53
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
so you can use DifferenceQuotient with the Direction option. You say FromBelow.

54
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You want to go from the left at <i>x</i> = 1, and you get back the answer. Then what you can do is

55
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
you can use that answer, which is just like the slope, to work out the tangent line,

56
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and you see that indeed you have a tangent line at the required point.

57
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But notice that you have a problem at 1. This is just going to be the left-hand derivative.

58
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay. Let’s go on now to find the derivative of this expression at 2. Now because you have

59
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
an absolute value, what you could do is analyze the expression a bit more

60
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and say that because 2 is less than 3, so the expression becomes 4 * (−<i>x</i> + 3),

61
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and then work out the derivative of that, which is just −4. Or you can simply use D itself

62
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
on the original function and get back just the same answer. What you can do finally is

63
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
to plot the derivative and original expression, the tangent line, and what you see over here is that

64
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
in fact you have a coincidence of tangent line with the function on the left, and that’s very typical of

65
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
of the absolute value function—namely, the tangent line will overlap the graph at some stage.

66
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay. Problem number 9 says compute the values of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> for which this function

67
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
becomes differentiable. Now that’s a much a harder problem because you need to check that

68
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
that you actually have the same left-hand and right-hand derivatives, and you also need to

69
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
some kind of continuity. Okay. We’re talking about derivatives. If you work out

70
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the derivative on the left. That’s 3<i>x</i>^2 + <i>a</i>, so at 2, the answer is going to be 12 + <i>a</i>.

71
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That must be equal to the derivative that’s over here, which is 2<i>bx</i> – 3, so that must be 4<i>b</i>.

72
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If you work out the left-hand limits, then you see over here when you plug in 2, you get 8 + 2<i>a</i>,

73
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and over there you get 4<i>b</i> – 3. Now both those must be satisfied for getting the values of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>,

74
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,000
so you solve the system and you get back <i>a</i>  as 1 and <i>b</i> as 13/4. Once you’ve got those values,

75
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
you can then plot everything and check that in fact you have a nice smooth expression over here.

76
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay. Let’s go on now to number 10, which says compute the tangent line of this function at 1.

77
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Now to compute the tangent line, you first of all need to find a value of the function at 1.

78
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You need to compute the slope at <i>x</i> = 1. You’ve got both those now. Then the tangent line

79
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
is <i>y</i> – <i>y</i>1 equal to slope times (<i>x</i> – <I>x</i>1). That’s the equation of the tangent line,

80
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and then you can do that over here to get a plot. You’ve got a plot now which shows clearly

81
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
that we’ve got the right tangent line in this case.

82
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay. Problem 11 says compute the normal line to a function at 4. Now the normal line,

83
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
keep in mind, is perpendicular to the tangent line. Of course you first find the value at 4.

84
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Then you compute the derivative at 4. The answer is −10. Now −10 is the slope of the tangent line,

85
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
so the slope of the normal must be 1/10. Use that information to work out

86
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:32,000
the equation of the normal over here, and then finally we plot the original function

87
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
along with the normal line at 4. You do see that the normal line is perpendicular to

88
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
the curve at that point, and of course it’s perpendicular to the tangent line at that point.

89
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Problem number 12 says that you’re given the position vector of a particle <i>s</i>[<i>t</i>]

90
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and you want to find the acceleration of that particle at a certain time, namely, <i>t</i> = 3π/2.

91
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Now the acceleration is the second derivative of the position, so you compute the second derivative.

92
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That’s the shorthand for the second derivative of the position. Then you plug in the <i>t</i> as 3π/2,

93
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and you get back the value. Then you can use that to actually plot both

94
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
the position and the acceleration, and that’s the plot of both those functions.

95
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The accretion is the second time derivative of the position.

96
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Problem number 13 says that you’re given a table of values, and from a table of values

97
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
for a function <i>f</i>[<i>x</i>], you want to compute the average rate of change of that function

98
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
over the range 6 to 12. Now the average rate simply means the slope of the secant line

99
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
between those two points, so you work it out. The values are 14 and 10 at those two points.

100
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We will divide (14 – 10) by (12 – 6), and you get back the average rate of change.

101
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Here’s a plot of the points in secant line. Of course secant line is not a very good approximation,

102
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
but often all that you have is a table of values.

103
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And finally, problem 14, which says compute the instantaneous rate of change of <i>z</i>

104
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
with respect to <i>y</i> for this function over here when <i>y</i> is π. Now when we say

105
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
instantaneous rate of change, what we mean is the derivative. You simply work out D at that point.

106
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That’s the instantaneous rate of change, and then using that, you can work out the tangent line.

107
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
When you do that, you actually see that you have the tangent line over here given by

108
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the instantaneous rate of change as its slope.

109
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
To summarize, the key concept for this problem was that the instantaneous rate of change

110
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:28,000
is the slope of the tangent line at that point. This brings me to the end of today’s problem session.

111
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I hope that you have benefited from the discussion. Do review the problems, and then in Lesson 9,

112
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
we’ll go on to talking about differentiation rules. But before doing that,

113
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
there is a small quiz for you to take. Do take Quiz 2, and then you’ll be ready for Lesson 9.

114
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Thank you very much. I hope that you’ve enjoyed today’s lesson. I’ll stop over here.
